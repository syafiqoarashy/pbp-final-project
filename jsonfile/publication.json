The method was optimal requirements with respect to the feed materials especially iron ore, coal as well as a binder. In this study, the experiments were conducted on physical properties of iron ore briquette from Aceh (Indonesia) to analyze its suitability to meet the feed requirements for iron production. The term iron ore briquette refers to the materials compressed under high pressure formed by variable mixtures of iron ore, coal and binders. In the experiments, the physical properties such as the tumbler index (TI), abrasion index (AI) and shatter indices of the iron ore briquette were carried out. The experimental results show that the iron ore briquette blended with coal and using asphalt as a binder has a high tumbler index (TI) or not easily breakable compared to the iron ore briquette using dammar powder as a binder. On the other hand, the blended coal in iron ore briquette with dammar powder as the binder significantly increases the shelter index or easily breakage.",

      "abstract": "The development of electric vehicles continues to increase along with the increasingly strong demands of environmentally friendly vehicles related to the issue of global warming which causes the greenhouse effect. Developed countries have already developed these vehicles first. There have been many studies on electric vehicles in countries that generally have 4 seasons a year. Developing countries which are generally located in the tropics continue to follow. There has not been much similar research here. Research on the use of electric vehicles in the tropics is very important. This area only knows 2 seasons and generally warm temperatures with high humidity. Cabin air conditioning (AC) is almost always used. In electric vehicles, efficient use of energy is very important, this is due to the problem of energy density of batteries that have not been able to match fossil fuel. Energy from a battery that should be distributed more into the power train will be divided. Thus the vehicle mileage is reduced. This research was conducted on hybrid type vehicles. Data retrieval was carried out in hybrid mode and battery electric vehicle (BEV) mode[1]. Thus it can be compared to be able to draw other conclusions, namely which type of vehicle is more beneficial in energy efficiency and roaming. The actual conditions typical of large cities in developing countries which are generally crowded and traffic jams will be an important variable. The vehicle used was a Toyota Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV). Test vehicle was normally driven with actual traffic conditions in large and urban cities in combination with traffic jams, toll roads (high ways), village roads and housing that are generally narrow. The vehicle's energy usage data was recorded in real time with a data logger including knowing the position of the vehicle and the altitude of the area in GPS.",

      "abstract": "The rapid development of science and technology affects the development of all products including motorized vehicles. The performance of resulted traction will change depending on the amount of charge received by the vehicle. The right selection of motor and tranmsission gear ratio is also the main key of vehicle’s proper traction performance. The results of the analysis of the powertrain electric vehicle (EV) system performance with two-speed transmission obtained by selecting a transmission ratio that is suitable for use in a vehicle is a transmission ratio of 1.96 for the 1st gear and of 1.25 for two speed, since the traction required by the motor is not too big to be able to do gearshift and thus the gear shift becomes smoother. Based on the results of friction analysis with traction, it can be concluded that the vehicle is unable to yield traction of 6.000 rpm at two speeds with a 10° road slope, due to the slope drag higher than the vehicle traction. As a result, the vehicle is only capable of traveling at 65.30 km/h at two speeds and of traveling at 49.98 km/h in the 1st gear. Based on the results of friction analysis with traction, it can be concluded that the vehicle is unable to yield traction of 5.000 rpm in gear 1 with a slope of 20°, due to the slope drag higher than the vehicle thrust/traction. Therefore, the vehicle is only capable of traveling at 41.65 km/h in the 1st gear and of traveling at 49.98 km/h in the 1st gear.",

      "abstract": "Indonesia has several Interconnected Electric Power Systems Networks (IEPSN) to supply electricity to the customers. Java, Sumatera, Sulawesi and Kalimantan are the four largest IEPSN in Indonesia. In recent years, Renewable Energy Power Plant (REPP) such as Solar Power Plant (SPP) and Wind Power Plant (WPP) are the most popular types of REPP and have been developed and operated widely in the world because of their advantages as clean energy, cheap fuel cost, and the investment costs are decreasing significantly. Recent years in Indonesia, SPP dan WPP have started to be developed in several regions. Based on the Longterm Planning Document of Electricity Development issued by Indonesia Government, in 2025 it is targeted that around 23% of the total energy mix in Indonesia will come from REPP. But on the other hand, the two types of power plants have intermittent/variable characteristics that vary rapidly according to weather and solar intensity conditions even naturally uncontrollable by the system operators. It is categorized as Variable Renewable Energy (VRE). This Intermittent nature has the potential to endanger the stability and reliability of IEPSN. Statistically, there have been several power outages in Europe, Australia and the United States triggered by the mass operation of VRE power plants. One of the root causes is lack of Grid Code that clearly regulates the operational of VRE. It raises a lot of researches to discover appropriate and specific adaptations of the existing Grid Code that unique for each IEPSN based on own characteristics of it, government policies, and the availability of local natural resources. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on Grid Code that have been implemented not only in Indonesia but also abroad. This paper also reviews characteristic of VRE from various textbook references, government regulations, and scientific journals. Furthermore, this paper explains the results of literature review on the adaptation of existing Grid Code toward VRE penetration in each IEPSN based on government regulations and scientific journals both in Indonesia and abroad.",

Based on the operating conditions that have been given, the fluid pressure coming out of turbine 2 greatly influences the net power produced by the cycle. R290 has a working pressure range that is narrower than the other two refrigerants as it has the highest dew point temperature among the three. The mass of working fluid that can be utilized in the cycle is also shown by R290 as the difference between LNG and condensation temperatures are relatively much higher than the other 2 refrigerants. As a result, R290 will provide the highest net power, but can only be used at maximum working fluid pressure of 550 kPa, which provides net power of around 880 kW. If the desired net power is higher than 880 kW, the R170 shows better performance than R1150.",

      "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) frequency band offers several advantages over microwave band such as larger bandwidth and radiation capability for various imaging applications. One of the important components is the THz detector that applicable for room temperature use. For the lower THz frequency band, an antenna-coupled microbolometer is considered as the THz wave detector due to its compact structure and easy to fabricate. In this paper we design and simulate the antenna-coupled microbolometer for 1 THz frequency band. Simulation is conducted by using CST Microwave Studio. A surface current analysis is performed to understand the effect of the increasing resistance of the microbolometer to the power efficiency performance. From the simulation results, the proposed design and analysis method reveals that the power efficiency of the microbolometer can be increased by increasing the resistance of the microbolometer.",

      "abstract": "The chrome alloy has better affinity with nitrogen atom in nitriding process than any other alloy elements in steel. The higher content of chrome element binds larger number of nitrogen atoms. However, the higher concentration of nitrogen atom on the surface of the steel does not often make thicker case depth. This study clarified the phenomenon. The nitriding process was performed in two stages, namely the boost stage in the fluidized bed with the composition of 80 % NH3 and 20 % of N2 in 4 hours at 550 0C. Subsequently, the diffusion process was carried out in fluidized bed with the gas composition of 100 % N2 HP (high purity) in 2 hours. The chemical composition was measured by spectrometry and EDAX. The case depth was identified by micro-Vickers, and metallography was observed by SEM. The concentration of nitrogen atom on the surface of AISI 316 L is twice higher than that on the AISI 4140. The result shows that 0.1 to 1 wt % of nitrogen atom creates diffusion layer, 1 to 5 wt % of nitrogen atom produces nitride layer of γꞌ and ε, and nitrogen atom above 5 wt % forms white layer. The layer strongly depends on the percentage of nitrogen atom concentration. The nitrogen atom concentration is determined by the concentration of chromium element within the steel (AISI 316 L). Meanwhile, the depth of nitrogen atom diffusion is highly determined by the alloy element of Fe (AISI 4140).",

Encapsulation is one solution that can be done for the efficiency of packaging process and distribution of agarwood oil. Four different formulations of agarwood oil encapsulation were obtained which differed in the ratio of the active substance to the encapsulation of maltodextrin and gum arabic (MD-GA), F1 (2:10), F2 (5:10), F3 (10:10) and F4 (12: 10). The result of the solid dosage evaluation obtained by the highest loading capacity was 68.6% in the F2 sample. Then surface oil content value of F1-F4 sample range from 3-21%. While the value of encapsulation efficiency in F1-F4 sample is 82-95.76%. In the morphological test all four samples showed a porous density part of the surface.

      "abstract": "In general, laterite nickel is divided into two types, namely limonite and saprolite [1]. Both are in different depths and have different levels of nickel content. Saprolite ores have a high nickel content (1.5-3%), while limonite has a lower nickel content (below 1.5%) [2] which causes the nickel refining process using pyrometallurgy (high temperature melting) techniques is very expensive. Laterite ores from Southeast Sulawesi used in this study still contain a lot of impurities. In the previous research phase of solvent extraction, using Versatic Acid 10 as a reactant was chosen to separate calcium and magnesium from the ore. This process produces mixed nickel metal with cobalt. To separate nickel from cobalt, the selection of extractant Cyanex 272 is used, therefore nickel remains in its aqueous phase while cobalt is in the organic phase. Nickel in the aqueous phase is then purified by another recovery technique such as electrowinning Electro Metal Winning (EMEW) technology. This process is still not established for processing nickel from laterite ores. The variation process which is held in this research such as time, voltage, and flow rate to receive the optimum results in the EMEW process and also the influence of additives, boric acid, needs to be considered to improve the electrowinning process. The result shows that the addition of boric acid 1M as additive, is the best and the concentration of nickel is about 1.39 mg while the optimum processing time is 2 hours. With increasing electrowinning time, the nickel metal deposited will increase at the cathode, in this case 1.67 mg is obtained. In addition, nickel deposits is about 1.82 mg occurred at flow rate 1 liter / minute.",

Problems in slurry flow such as the sedimentation of particles in the bottom occur. The recent study on slurry drainage was using spiral pipes show more efficient results than the circular pipe. Spiral pipe application can minimize deposition at the bottom side of the pipe that was caused by the flow pattern which forms a tangential flow pattern following the shape of the pipe wall. Therefore, this present study aims to examine the characteristics of mud slurry rheological in some variation of concentration weight, Cw 20%, 30%, and 40%. Then each fluid working is compared with the change of mass variation when slurry flowed. The method used is to compare the flow of mud slurry in the spiral pipe ratio of pitch per outside diameter (P/Do) = 7.3 and 3.1 and a circular pipe with a diameter of 25.4 mm. The data were collected by varying flow rate of valve opening angle in 20 points of steps. To determine the power law index as the properties constants of non-Newtonian flow, all data were calculated using the basic equation as tools of the rheological model. By this experimental, we reveal that to control the efficiency of slurry in the piping system, the appropriate concentration and geometry of channel are very important.",

      "abstract": ". Oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) is one of prominent lignocellulosic wastes from oil palm industries and has the potential for feedstock of biobased products. However, the delignification must be applied. This study investigated the effect of microwave assisted alkaline pretreatment of OPEFB by using response surface methodology with Box-Behnken design (BBD) to find the optimum pretreatment conditions. OPEFB (30 mesh) were treated by various concentrations of aqueous sodium hydroxide. The effect of three variables such as microwave power (280-840 Watt), NaOH concentration (1-3 % w/v), and reaction time (3-9 min) were evaluated to improve lignin removal. The quadratic model indicated that microwave power of 832.9 Watt, NaOH concentration of 2.7% (w/v), and reaction time of 8.9 min resulted the highest lignin removal of 88.10%. Moreover, to evaluate the effectiveness of the pretreatment, FTIR and SEM analysis were employed on the untreated and treated OPEFB. These results showed that microwave assisted alkaline pretreatment of OPEFB could effectively remove the lignin under relatively short period of time and low alkaline concentration.",

      "abstract": "The non-volatile phenolic compounds of red ginger oleoresin are known for their antioxidant properties to counteract free radicals. Traditionally, the oleoresin of red ginger was used to treat inflammation, arthritis, and other diseases. The drawbacks of ginger oleoresin are their short shelf life, rapid degradation when exposed to air, light, water, high temperature, and, low-pH condition in the gastric area. Hence, the objective of this research was to obtain chitosan-alginate matrices to encapsulate red ginger oleoresin for extended release in the gastrointestinal tract. The matrices were prepared using the ionotropic gelation method with the weight ratio of chitosan to alginate in range of 1:0 to 1:0.5. The formulations were characterized using liquid chromatography, infrared spectrometry, and scanning electron microscopy. The encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity were determined based on the total phenolic content in the samples. The in vitro release assays of ginger oleoresin in simulated gastrointestinal fluids showed that the chitosan-alginate matrix with a weight ratio of chitosan to alginate 1:0.5 have a low release in simulated gastric fluid (4%) and moderate release in simulated colonic fluid (41%). The results indicated that by selecting the formulation of the chitosan-alginate matrices, the release of the bioactive compounds of ginger oleoresin can be targeted to certain areas in the gastrointestinal tract. The chitosan-alginate matrices had the potential to be used as a carrier to deliver bioactive compounds via oral administration.",

Owing to the fast cooling rate during DED, the specimen exhibited the diffusionless transformation products of martensite (α′) and massive (αm) phases. In the top layer, the α′ exhibited a needle-like morphology with the width of approximately 0.94 μm. Meanwhile, the αm presented a lamellar structure with α thickness of nearly 0.98 μm. In contrast, the morphology of α′ and αm started to decompose into α+β phase in the bottom layer. Furthermore, the hardness values increased with higher deposition layers. These phenomena could be explained by the effect of repetitive heating, as the nature of DED method during the depositing of new layers. Moreover, it was observed the α thickness of αm in the bottom layer was finer than that in the top layer due to the higher cooling rate.",

The morphology of Ti-6Al-4V alloy depends on the cooling rates during the cooling from β region. The αm, which has a transformation characteristic between martensite (α′) and α diffusion, is reported to be a potential method for obtaining a fine lamellar α/β by a thermal decomposition. The different fraction of αm was found after DSST with the first stage was conducted above the β-transus temperature at 1050 °C, followed by a second annealing at different temperatures in the α+β region. It was found that the formation of αm exists in specific temperature region. A longer period in this region, which was calculated based different cooling rates during DSST, will increase the fraction of αm in the specimen. All specimens after DSST contain αm with the α width of approximately 1μm and white-dot particles, which is predicted to be V-enriched precipitates. The DSST can be a potential method for producing a high fraction of αm, which can be thermally decomposed into a fine lamellar α/β, introducing a Ti-6Al-4V alloy with superior mechanical properties.",

However, the choice of travel mode for school trips in developing countries is still unclear so far. Most school teens participate in making decisions about the modes of their school trips, while school trips for young children are decided solely by their parents. Thus, school adolescents will be considered as key stakeholders in transportation policy and studying the journey of this pattern of schoolchildren is very important to understand the choice of travel mode decisions.

Chemical injection using surfactant is one of EOR technologies that has been proved to be able to increase the oil recovery. In this study, surfactant was synthesized employing palm oil as a hydrophobic group and polyethylene-glycol as hydrophilic groups. The use of natural oil as the raw material is likely due to its abundance and environmentally friendly. Esterification of nonionic surfactant was performed by utilizing the azeotrope technique (EtOAc-H2O) between oleic acid and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400. The Reaction was optimized by a various mole equivalent of oleic acid and PEG (1:1,1; 1:2,5; 1;3) as well as various time reaction. Product surfactant was characterized by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), acid value (AV), and ester value (ES) to determine the optimum condition and reaction conversion. The Molecular structure of surfactant was confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR as well as MS. Nonionic surfactant was then analyzed by measuring the interfacial tension (IFT) of oil and water. The results showed that the optimum condition to obtain the lowest IFT was achieved by reacting oleic acid and PEG at mole equivalent ratio of 1:3 and 5 hours reaction time, with conversion reaction of 93.7% mole. This nonionic surfactant was able to decrease the IFT of oil and water as low as 10-4 dyne/cm in brine salinity condition of 18000 ppm and oil 34,39oAPI.",

In Indonesia, mechatronics is a fairly new science, the ability of Indonesian human resources in this science has not been evenly distributed for students and for students involved in the engineering field. However, the sophisticated mechatronic tools distributed in the Indonesian market have even been used by various parties. This is a potential for Indonesian engineering graduates because these tools require operators who are reliable in the field of science or the maintenance needs of the mechatronic device itself. One way to improve Indonesia's human resources is to increase interest in the field of mechatronics early on. High school students have been given an introduction to mechatronic devices. However, in its introduction needed the ability to make programs that are fairly difficult so that it can discourage students, therefore a measurement module will be made consisting of several sensors which are mechatronic devices, and applications that can read measurement values and carry out basic logic. The choice of an Android-based application is due to the general use of smart phones and the wider range of Android users. Bluetooth connections are also attached to connect modules and smart phones and add a sophisticated impression compared to when connected using a cable. In addition to introducing students, this device can also find out the potential possessed by the mechatronics field.",

      "abstract": "Indonesia’s energy consumption keeps increasing every year. The energy mix strategy is one of the ways that the government implement to reduce the use of fossil fuel. Therefore there needs to be more infrastructure to increase the consumption of natural gas in everyday activities. The purpose of this study is to obtain the technical design and feasibility study of gas distribution network in Summarecon Serpong. The study was conducted with a basis of Summarecon Serpong’s geographical and population condition. There are 2 tapping points determined on the network, so the network is divided into 2 systems. Technical calculations are carried out with hydraulic analysis using software. Pipe network use MRS and pressure regulators to measure flow rates and reduce pressure on each system. The pipes used are steel pipes and polyethylene pipes. Of the 2 systems designed, at the farthest point of the network the pressure is 0.12 bar and 0.29 bar. Technical drawings are based on the results of calculations and contain the required material and isometric drawings. Bill of quantity is based on technical drawings as a basis for calculating investments. The suitable selling price of gas for the project is IDR 7,700 for household customers and IDR 6,400 for commercial customers. This is indicated by the NPV value of 3 billion rupiah, IRR 11.36%, and PBP 8 years.",

Several testing was conducted to examine the results of spherical powder among other observations using a Digital Microscope (Dino-Lite AM4115), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM-FEI-Inspect F50) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). To ensure the purity of 316L stainless steel spherical powder results, EDS was used as qualitative and quantitative elemental analysis. The results of 316L stainless steel spherical powder particles vary from 26 µm to 180 µm. Average particle diameters of approximately 82.6 µm, ideal for biomedical applications. Effect of feed metal flow rate on powder weight percentages result at particle sizes <50 µm for 2 mm3/s metal flow rate, 3 mm3/s metal flow rate, and 4 mm3/s metal flow rate are 13.09%, 28.04%, and 26.04% respectively. It is possible that this could occur because the larger metal flow rates require greater plasma energy to make liquid metal droplets. So that the lower the metal flow rate at the same energy consumption, it is possible to produce more metal powder in smaller size particles.",

The study aims to understand the potential HST passenger travel characteristics, which is important in predicting the HST demand. This study conducts a roadside interview using a stated preference methodology for several transport modes passenger serving Jakarta-Bandung namely; private vehicle, train, intercity bus and para transit. Moreover, the study extends in observing the short trip passenger preference. The analysis defines that the preferred fares are 300.000 (20 USD), which is increased compared to 2016 studies. The forecasting results of demand for fast trains based on the probability of modal transfers amounted to 54,764 passengers per day with details of the number of trips Jakarta-Bandung was 27,005 while the Bandung-Jakarta trip was 27,759. The results for a significant difference between the total daily trips of Bandung-Jakarta and Jakarta-Bandung have already been seen since the initial statistical analysis where according to survey data, people who traveled Bandung-Jakarta were more elastic compared to Jakarta-Bandung trips. This finding shows clearly that the passenger traffic vehicle capitulates with the current road traffic highway conditions. Note that they are more uncertainty in condition on road traffic in comparison to the railway passenger. In more details, a sensitivity analysis indicates that the passenger from Jakarta is easier to shift using the HST compared to the passenger from Bandung. There is an indication that the Jakarta people has higher value of time as they have higher preference to shift toward faster transport mode compared to Bandung people. This information is also useful for operation policy including ticketing differentiation based on travel time period and travel origin-destination.",

This paper studies, the behavior of before-after recycle and heat treatment to several grades of dental gypsum that will be used as impression material or dies. As it’s designed to be an impression material that will undergo heat treatment, Simultaneous Thermogravimetry and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (TGA-DSC) will be applied to understand the Phase Transformation to its mass change and the behavior to a temperature difference. The result will be validated using an experimental approach. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscope will also be done to identify the crystalline phases and the surface microstructure, it will be validated using an experimental approach as well. A range of gap between parameter values is expected between the fresh/new dental gypsum and the recycled one. However, it is expected some similar values between the heat treated and the fresh/new dental gypsum.",

Their characteristics are more convenient to learn when there is an experiment or learning tools which uses radiation as its main process. Therefore, the objective of this research is to design and built an experimental tool in reference to the process of the well-known radiometer apparatus. Radiometer is used to measure heat flux that is emitted from a heat source with heat flux sensor as the measuring instrument. Compared to radiometer that already exists, the design of this radiometer has some advantages. It is user-friendly, portable, and has a low manufacturing cost. There are some additional features in this radiometer and those are: variation of measurement range in x, y, and z axis, measurement of view factor, measurement of tilt plane to acknowledge convection effect to heat transfer process, and the design uses Flat Plate Radiant Heater. This paper shows the outcome of measurement from radiometer as well as analyzes the phenomena which emerges during the measurement of heat flux emitted from a flat plate radiant heater.",

Therefore, protein content in cheese whey has a potential to be converted become peptide and amino acids which has functional effect in biological activity. Peptides and amino acids can be produced through fermentation with Candida tropicalis as indigenous whey from cheese whey. Cheese whey are fermented with the C.tropicalis and also naturally fermented as control at ambient for 48 hours. Peptide content identified by folin ciocalteu methods and the amino acid profile is determined by HPLC. Fermentation result showed that the maximal content of peptides need a 24 hour fermentation in 10.42 ppm. Peptides content decreased as the further fermentation caused by the degradation peptides become amino acids. Amino acids profile from C. tropicalis fermentation showed the reduction of amino acids besides isoleucine. It's suspected due to releasing bond of amine with C. tropicalis metabolism or fermentation.",

      "abstract": "Virtual manufacturing is a new technology implementing the virtual reality of simulation of a manufacturing process. This virtual technology of manufacturing can minimize the risk of manufacture failures because the parameters of a process can be determined precisely before the real manufacturing process. This technology is suitable to be implemented in the process planning of high-risk patchings such as hydroforming tubular metal patch processing in an oil and gas well. In this paper, the Hydroforming of Casing Patch (HCP) is used for replacing a conventional method of casing patch repair using a cementing base technique (cement squish). The HCP process is a method for forming or fixing a tube by providing a pressurized fluid into a tubular tube so that it has the same form as the outer casing. The analysis process starts with calculating the dimension of HCP and then generating the 3D model of HCP as an input for simulation. Furthermore, the 3D model of HCP is verified by using the virtual manufacturing method. The virtual manufacturing simulates the 3D model casing patch forming process in real time with a set of parameters. After the casing patch model is verified, a prototype is built to validate it. According to the virtual manufacturing result, the Inside Diameter (ID) of HCP is 0.37 % lower than the calculation result and the thickness of HCP from the virtual manufacturing result is 4.29 % higher than the calculation result. The results prove that the HCP design was verified. In addition, the experiment proves that the prototype can resist the pressure of transient loads from 20.01 liters of water from 0 to 23.79 MPa for 18 minutes without damage. Therefore, the design of HCP dimensions and its process planning are valid.",

Responding to this PT. Tanjung Priok Port as a subsidiary of PT. Pelabuhan Indonesia II (Persero) which is in charge of managing all operations and port services in Tanjung Priok is required to improve the performance of loading and unloading services, especially in the loading and unloading sector. The international container flow flows of PT Pelabuhan Tanjung Priok reach 67.11% from 232,87 thousand TEUs in 2015 to 503,90 thousand TEUs in 2016. And for domestic container growth of 9.50% 132 thousand TEUs to 141 thousand TEUs in 2016. With an increasing number of containers each year and a limited Container Yard location, PT. Tanjung Priok Port implements a truck lossing system in several terminals, one of which is in South Container Terminal. The author conducted a study to reduce the length of waiting time for container transport trucks as a result of the application of truck lossing system. The problem solving process is done by scheduling the arrival of container haul truck with Truck Turnaround Time approach. From the results of the scheduling implementation the waiting time of the container truck can be lowered from 99,28 minutes to 48,72 minutes.",

The Langmuir isotherm model best fits the phenol adsorption onto coconut shell-based activated carbon with the maximum adsorption capacity for both unsterilized and sterilized type was found to be 17.5439 mg/g and 13.6986 mg/g, respectively. The EEMs results showed that the humic-like substances peak almost completely disappear post-adsorption. Furthermore, it was found that the nanoparticle size distribution was also shifted from ranges of 0.72 – 1.74 nm contained in raw water into diameter of 45.66 – 726.73 nm post-adsorption and 57.08 – 1068.47 nm in diameter for both unsterilized and sterilized water samples, respectively, suggesting the phenol adsorption had occurred.

      "abstract": "This paper proposes design of parasitic microstrip antenna with multiple feed line for mobile communication applications at working frequency of 1800 MHz. The purpose of adding multiple feed line is to enhanced the bandwidth of the proposed antenna. The multiple feed line used has an impedance of 100 Ohm and is placed on the edge of the patch parasitic microstrip antenna. The optimal bandwidth of the microstrip antenna is obtained by adjusting the dimensions and position of the multiple feed line. From the simulation results obtained return loss of -15.95 dB, VSWR of 1.379 at work of frequency 1800 MHz and bandwidth of 328 MHz with a frequency range 1735 - 2053 MHz or increased 262.13% compared to parasitic microstrip antenna. From the results obtained it can be concluded that the use of multiple feed line succeeded in increasing the performance and bandwidth of the microstrip antenna.",

AISI 304L is chosen as a base material with autogenous welding and butt joint configuration. The dimension of the base material is 120 x 50 mm and the thickness of 3 mm. The welding with pulsed current and constant current are used in the welding process in this study. In the pulse current, the mean current is made all the same with a constant current of 100 amperes. The peak current, base current and time of peak and base current are varied to make it the same. The welding speed used is constant at 2.0 mm/s. The result shows that the HAZ area will get shrinkage if welded using pulsed current welding. The welding with pulsed current can produce more fine cellular dendritic structure than the welding with a constant current. The UTS in the welding with pulsed current is lower than the welding with constant current, while the impact toughness in the welding with pulsed current is higher than the welding with a constant current. The highest of the UTS and the impact toughness of 577.62 MPa on parameter 65-A and 27 J on parameter 65-C, respectively.",

PT Cladtek BI-Metal Manufacturing is engaged in the manufacturing industry for various jobs concerning metal materials, specifically the weld overlay process such as Cladding on carbon steel pipes for industrial use. The quality of steel pipe products in the past four months is low, as indicated by the presence of several types of defects. The low quality of steel pipe products (defects) resulted in a decrease in production the following month. The purpose of this study was to analyze the quality control of steel pipe products in steel pipe products in the weld overlay process to meet PT Cladtek BI-Metal Manufacturing's client quality standards. Data analysis is done by using variable control maps and attribute control maps. The analysis of the factors causing high repair using fishbone diagrams. Based on the results of processing the data above it is known that the types of defects that are beyond the control limits are the type of defect Poor Profile, Cluster Porosity, Low Clad, Linear. This shows that during the weld overlay process it still does not pay attention to the company's quality standards. The factors that cause the incompatibility of the production process are human, machine, work method, and material. Based on these conditions, the company should be able to make a commitment to support the implementation of quality control in the weld overlay process so that employees can work with loyalty and care during the process. So that it can have an impact on increasing the productivity of employees who work in the welding overlay process.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis suggested the resulting phases were zirconium oxide (Baddeleyite) with a monoclinic crystal system along with cobalt oxide as a secondary phase. The increasing cobalt content caused the XRD peaks to shift into lower angle due to the substitution of Zr atom to smaller Co atom in a crystal lattice. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showed the samples with higher Co content had a smoother surface. Generally, the microstructures of Co-doped zirconia powders consisted of large agglomerates with small particles on the surface.",

These figures indicate a dire need to provide more opportunities for children to be physically active daily through active school travel (walking, cycling), free play and peer-play so that they are able to develop better all-round fitness, a wider range of social skills, and greater mental resilience. Schools and communities have attempted to design programs to encourage healthy lifestyles through walking and cycling to school. Although child health statistics have plateaued and they suggest that a new approach is needed. Some of the major barriers include real and perceived issues of road safety and hazards lack of meaningful community engagement buy-in to walk and cycle to school programs. For example, research undertaken in the ACT from 2016-2018 show that engaging children in the process of designing new solutions for their health and wellbeing can be a way forward in establishing healthy habits and social norms around walking and cycling to school. This paper outlines several projects that enabled co-design with children and practitioners as well as strategies for engaging local government and schools in the design process.",

A WSN comprises nodes with capabilities to sense, process and forward information with preferably low energy consumption to prolong the network life-time. This study investigates the use of Reed Solomon (RS) codes as an error correction code to provide reliability to the data transmission in Rayleigh and Nakagami-m distributed fading channels, and their effects on the energy consumption. Simulation results show that while the energy consumption in a network increases in accordance to the increase of the number of nodes for both fading channels, the required energy is significantly higher to obtain low bit error probability for low number of nodes. When the number of nodes in the network is low, the energy needed by the code capable of a higher level of protection almost matches that needed by the code that provides low protection level. The trade-off between code strength and energy consumption is an important factor to consider when the number of nodes in the network is high.",

In this present work, 10 wt. % of sodium sulfate as additive and 5, 10, 15 wt.% of palm shell charcoal as reductant were used. The reduction of nickel ore was performed at 950ºC, 1050ºC and 1150ºC for 60, 90 and 120 minutes. A wet magnetic separation method was then carried out to separate the concentrates and tailings. Characterization of reduced ore was performed by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Optical Microscope (OM) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), while the composition of ferronickel concentrate was identified by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF). The result showed that the higher temperature reduction, the higher of nickel grade and its recovery at the concentrate. Nevertheless, the longer reduction time and the more reductant in nickel ore lowering the nickel grade and its recovery in the concentrate. The optimum condition in this selective reduction process was obtained with added 5 wt.% of reductant and 10 wt. % of sodium sulfate in nickel ore reducing at 1150ºC for 60 minutes resulting in 4.60% and 73.23% for nickel grade and its recovery, respectively.",

In this study, the nano-Al2O3used varied from 0.1 vf-% to 1.2 vf-%, which subsequently determined the optimum point. In addition, the magnesium with 10% are added as a wetting agent between aluminium and nano-Al2O3as reinforced. Stir casting process is carried out for 2 minutes and 4 minutes for the degassing process using argon gasses then pouring molten metal in to the mold at 800oC. The effect of nano-Al2O3on the mechanical properties and microstructure of the composites was investigated. The result showed that the tensile strength decreased with the addition of nano-Al2O3but the hardness increased. Increasing of hardness mainly caused by grain refinement, and particle strengthening which act as obstacles to the motion of dislocations. Addition of nano-Al2O3as reinforced also tend to form microporosity and agglomeration which would decrease the tensile strength of composites. The optimum strength was reached by 0.5 vf-% nano-Al2O3with the value of 140 MPa and hardness of 46 BHN which was supported by low porosity level.",

In implant planning, the accuracy of dimension and degree of the 3D printed model are critical, since it takes effect on the success of implant installation. A computerized tomography (CT) pelvis area was segmented to obtain the region of interest, iliac organ, with several procedures. The outcome from segmentation is converted from the format of digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) version to the ready to print format of stereolithography (STL). The DICOM data and the STL data were then captured in the same dimension and position. The key process of this research was conducting an algorithm of template matching to verify quantitatively that the original CT data of iliac organ is accurately identic with its 3D models. This paper establishes a cutting-edge analysis that answers the percentage of similarity between the original data with the 3D model of 94,46%. The result provides a recommendation to continue the 3D model to be imprinted and it contributes to the high exactitude of anatomical printed models.",

      "abstract": "Osteosarcoma as the most frequent bone tumor cases can be found in the pelvis bone. Within the pelvis, the ilium is the most common location for osteosarcoma, followed by the acetabulum and then the ischium. Surgery of pelvis is difficult and the reconstruction is complicated mainly due to the geometry complexity and also the weight support function of the pelvis. Endoprosthesis of the ilium is therefore designed to increase the quality of life of the patient. In this study, the iliac implant is designed based on the natural geometry of the ilium, and the size is modified to fit the morphometry of the Eastern Asian. A finite element analysis is proposed as a basic study in material selection. Titanium and its alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) are studied as the potential candidate for the proposed implant while the finite analysis of the bone was also included. As a preliminary study, in this finite element analysis, only the static load is given, each material is assumed to be isotropic and the contacts were considered bonded. Finite element analysis in this study is expected to give a better understanding of the stress distribution and further considered to optimize the selection of the materials.",

This paper has two objectives. The first is to optimize the ability of the existing stair lift structure by developing lighter stair lift designs and materials without reducing the capability of the stair lift. The second is to design a braking system on the stair lift. The optimization of a stair lift structural design is needed to ensure that the strength of the stair lift structure complies with the requirements of ASME standard 18.1. The methodologies of this study are redesigning and conducting numerical simulations with the finite element to get the optimum result. Numerical simulations on the guide rails were carried out on A36 steel and 6063 T5 aluminum materials by comparing 30o and 45o stair lift inclinations. The maximum load is 270.4 kg. The distance of support is 1000 mm. From the simulation results, the 6063 T5 aluminum profile can be used as a material substitution for guide rails. The chains for driving links need to be strengthened by adding the dimensions of the chain or increasing the number of chains. The maximum temperature distribution on the disc brakes is 130.56 oC.",

      "abstract": "The amount of total knee arthroplasty (TKA) procedures in global is expected to rise four times by 2030 due to the ageing global population. One of the most reason for revision surgery in TKA is due to patello-femoral complications. Conformity between trochlea and femoral condyles of femoral component implant to normal anatomy knee should be observed since it affects how mechanical stress is distributed along the knee flexion. Inappropriate femoral component implant geometry and size can cause overstuffing of the patellofemoral joint during TKA. Overstuffing of patellofemoral section is related to anterior knee pain and aseptic loosening of implant. Here, we extend the study of patellofemoral aspect of TKA by studying the effect of patellar groove features of femoral component acting as trochlea to mechanical performance of femoral component during static loading by computational model and finite element method (FEM). TKA’s femoral component are designed based on commercial products and knee morphometry of adult Indonesian. Each designs have similar geometrical features and size except for the area that represents the patellar groove on natural anatomic knee. One design has a flat surface on the patellar groove, while the other has curvatures on the patellar groove. Based on von Mises stress and volumetric strain, the two designs have similar mechanical performance to bear static load. Comparative study on cortical bone vs Ti-6Al-4V shows that the proposed implant material is representative to replace natural bone in terms of mechanical performance.",

Therefore it is a necessary to build a robust and efficient authentication system. Zero-knowledge protocol is a cryptographic method that does not expose any secrecy in communication channel. The solution proposed is to implement an interactive password-less authentication. Here two identification schemes based on the zero-knowledge protocol is implemented on Android smartphone, first a modified parallelism on the Feige-Fiat-Shamir scheme and second, the difficulty of prime number factoring on Guillo-Quisquater scheme. This paper presents running-time and security analysis benchmarking of both schemes. Experiment results show that the modified Feige-Fiat-Shamir scheme with quadratic running-time is faster than exponential running-time on the Guillo-Quisquater scheme, at the same length of public key size.",

In turn, the architecture becomes a product of the future and of social change that is leading to both recognition of symbolic dominance and a field of power contestation. However, despite can generate positive effects, the reassertion of power practice in the architecture does not always occur smoothly and peacefully. The implementation of the power such as progressive societal and legislative agendas is also possible, in common with the rhetoric of unity in pluralism. This becomes a particular symbol of production of a group with its own set of preferences and is also mostly used to an increasingly broad distribution of power ruling regime. In this situation, the representation of the architecture can lose its aesthetic autonomy, and becomes an effective medium in structuring and representing the power in the framework of everyday life. This paper is written based on a qualitative approach by collecting and structuring field data through several methods such as observation, fieldwork study, interviews, and group discussion. Through this paper, it is used to show how the practice of power has been connecting to urban architecture in Pekanbaru city. This connection became a key role in reinvigorating the existing field of privileged practices. This can be found Malay architecture has been appointed the main reference for urban architecture that must be applied on built forms of the city. From this case, urban architecture becomes a designated-agent that is regulated and directed by whoever holds the power.",

Besides, the willingness to serve and to pay is assessed. The real demand survey was conducted by distributing the questionnaires and through direct interviews with 200 samples in 11 sub-districts in Padang City with a stratified random sampling method. 51% of the respondents were served by public water supply PDAM, 44% by non-piping, and 5% by community-based water supply and sanitation (Pamsimas). 62% of the respondents who subscribe to PDAM still consume bottled water for their drinking water for practical reasons and because of PDAM water tastes of chlorine. From the respondents not served by PDAM, 45% of respondents expressed interest in obtaining the piping service. The potential areas for increasing the service coverage are Kuranji Subdistrict, Koto Tangah Subdistrict, Pauh Subdistrict, and Lubuk Begalung Subdistrict. Some households choose not to be served by PDAM due to the non-continuous water supply and it being too expensive. A customer who wants to be served can pay a connection fee of between IDR 100,000 to IDR 500,000. Meanwhile, for the water rates every month cover around IDR 50,000–150,000 or 3-10% of their income. The PDAM still needs to improve its water supply systems in terms of continuity and water quality, especially for the existing service areas.",

After used this product it will go into the natural environment, especially to the marine ecosystems. These non-biodegradable microparticles have an adverse impact on it. This microplastics mix with plankton and sediments, causing suspended or detrimental organisms to ingest them by accident, as they are not always able to distinguish them from food. Problems will arise more dangerous if these small organisms are eaten by such as birds, marine mammals, turtles, fishes, etc. which causes the microplate to be transferred along the food chain, until it reaches the human being. There is a great need to develop effective abrasive substances for cosmetic industries. An alternative to microbeads may be beads based on biopolymers. Nowadays, there is a popular natural product call for propolis. In Indonesia there are many beekepeer start to raise that stinglessbee to get propolis. After harvesting the beehives, the propolis can be extracted by ethanol extract and there is a side product from the extraction that we call dry mud propolis. Also this product will be an alternative way to overcome the microplastic as a scrub because of its size, solubility, abbrasiveness, and active compound. This study characterizes physicals and chemicals then compare them to plastic microplastics that are used as exfoliants in cosmetics. This will help the farm bee propolis to overcome their problem by this side product (dry mud propolis) that still does not use the marine ecosystems.",

      "abstract": "This paper explains some comparison of granite and solid-surfaces starting from extraction, production, distribution, installation, and disposal. The excessive consumption of natural resources will cause a negative impact on nature, therefore the emergence of engineered material (such as solid-surface) is expected to reduce this consumption. Natural granite and solid surface have their own advantages and disadvantages. On each aspect, they have a positive or negative impact on the environment, economy, and society. This paper emphasizes the difference between those two materials, we assumed that the solid-surface has a lot of advantages than natural granite.",

Researchers tend to use another method of artificial neural networks, such as backpropagation neural network, probability neural networks, as the classifier for vector-based classification problems. In this paper, we would like to use a CNN classifier in the problems of 6 classes of three mixture of odor using 4 and 6 channels of sensors. In order to compare the performance of the vector based convolutional neural network, back-propagation neural network is also used to classify the same vector-based odor classification problems. The Experiment results show that vector-based convolutional neural network yields a quite high recognition rate compare with that of backpropagation neural network. The vector-based convolutional neural network produced more than 95% recognition rate for each data type, while the backpropagation neural network can only achieve a maximum recognition rate of 56% for each data type.",

      "abstract": "A compact ultra-wideband (UWB) bandpass filter based on cross dumbbell stub with notch band structures is proposed and implemented. This bandpass filter (BPF) structure consists of directly feed line input/output. As the novelty, the cross dumbbell stub resonator was used and it was placed at the middle of the filter structure. By using this structure, the BPF not only has a compact size but also it has a wide-passband response. To remove unnecessary radio frequency (RF) signal, the rejection (notch) band was also proposed by using a novel technique which uses U-shaped defected microstrip structure (DMS). Moreover, the DMS is constructed at the center of crossed dumbbell resonator. This notch band structure has highly independent and it can be adjusted by modifying the U-shaped structure. So, the specific frequency of the notch band can be selected independently without an expanded number of resonator or stub. Furthermore, this BPF is fabricated on 2D - Duroid/RT 5880 substrate with permittivity er = 2.2, thickness h = 1.57 mm, and loss tangent tand = 0.0009. Furthermore, the measured results show that the UWB-BPF has 3-dB passband from 3.0 – 12.2 GHz, with notch band at 6.7 GHz and the notch band has attenuation -22 dB. The design structure was verified by a good agreement between simulated and measured result. Overall, the proposed filter design has excellent performance in term of insertion loss, high independent notch-band, compact size, and implementable structures.",

In this paper, we use nine types of time frequency domains as features, PCA as dimension reduction method and Back-propagation Neural Network as classifiers.

In this research, two die materials, H13 and Cr-Mo-V steels were used. Those dies were then treated by two process variables, shot peening and nitriding-shot peening. To simulate the die casting process, the samples were dipped into molten Aluminum-Si alloy, ADC12 at 680oC for 30, 300 and 1800 seconds. Characterizations were focused on the surface of the steel which includes microstructure observation by microscope, microhardness profile, compound identification, and weight loss measurements. It was found that H13 steel and Cr-Mo-V steel treated by nitriding–shot peening have higher hardness up to 100% and thinner intermetallic layer. On H13 steel, the compact layer thickness decreased from 19 μm to 17 μm and from 96 μm to 80 μm for the broken layer. Similar trends occurred for Cr-Mo-V steel, where the thickness of compact layer and broken layer decreased from 38 μm to 19 μm and 119 μm to 45 μm respectively. These results indicate that H13 and Cr-Mo-V steels that were treated by nitriding–shot peening have a better resistance to die soldering.",

Active carbon-based supercapacitor electrodes provide high energy and energy performance due to their high surface area, high conductivity, and the ability to enable activated carbon to optimize the properties of their supercapacitors. In this article it is also reported about the manufacture of supercapacitors by utilizing activated carbon from various biomass as electrode material and the performance of supercapacitors compared to batteries. The activation method, type of activator, type of electrolyte, carbonation or pyrolysis process used will determine the energy and density of energy produced by supercapacitors. In this case the process of forming an electric double layer on the surface of the electrode was also reviewed and the effect of the type of electrolyte used on the performance of supercapacitors. The use of organic electrolytes can actually improve the performance of supercapacitors but in terms of ecology the use of acetonitrile solvents is not good for the environment. In this paper we recommend the simplest and lowest-cost fabrication technology but have more performance than the technology of poets such as lithium and alkaline batteries.",

The availability of RTC services is critical because the number of internet users has continued to increase in recent years. WebSocket is a full-duplex data transmission technology that can support RTC. In general, the implementation of WebSocket apply to web-based applications, but in this study applied to mobile applications. The resulting application is a screen sharing application between server and client, but it is not yet known the performance of RTC transmission data on applications that use WebSocket technology. Screen Sharing is a system designed to share the screen display of presentations between presenters and participants without using a projector. There are two main applications on this system, namely the Screen Sharing Server application and the Screen Sharing Client application. The measurement of the transmitted frame image and the size of the data consumed (bytes per second) between the server and client in the screen sharing process is the main focus of this study. The experimental results showed that after the Screen Sharing Server and Screen Sharing Client application was run for 20 seconds, we can find out that *.JPG is an image file type that has the highest average frame value transmitted at ten frames per second (fps), so you can support RTC. Whereas *.WEBP is an image file type that consumes the smallest data that is 44,970.6 (Kb) when the data transmission process is between the server and client.",

      "abstract": "Peatland fire became a serious problem in Indonesia until nowadays. The most problem of peat fire was caused by converting peatland become plantation area, wherein need canal blocking to adjust water ground as crop planting requirement in peatland. The structure design of this canal blocking should be strong enough to block excessive water level degradation so that can sustain the peatland environment. The current design of canal blocking was used wood as building structure, which has nor water-resistant, therefore, it can be rotten and easy to collapse. Indonesian Rubber Research Institute (IRRI) has already developed novel technology of canal blocking, namely natural rubber composite based water level canal blocking to overcome this problem. This novel technology was used natural rubber composite as material structure, therefore it has higher water-resistant, longer service life, and higher acid resistance than traditional canal blocking. In addition, novel canal blocking has equipped with water level system, which could control the groundwater level were suitable enough for crop planting requirement in peatland. Indeed, novel canal blocking could sustain peatland environment through peatland fire risk reduction, carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction and increase peatland plantation production. This technology has already installed in South Sumatera. Present work would be detailed review structure strength novel canal blocking, environment and economic impact on its application. The application result had determined successful to reduce CO2 emissions up to 3,723.38 ton CO2 /ha during 7 months installation. Furthermore, the production of the intercropping system (palm oil and corn) in peatland within novel canal blocking was increasing the profit wherein the net B/C of novel canal blocking application was 0.99, while traditional design canal blocking application was 0.84",

Then want to see the extent of the implementation or implementation carried out to achieve the GHG emission reduction target in the NDC. And, seeing the utilization of the ratification of the Paris Agreement for the development of the energy sector in Indonesia. Thus, it will be illustrated how Indonesia's readiness is facing the Paris Agreement in 2020., In this thesis, there are a number of obstacles for Indonesia to achieve the NDC target as well as the future solutions. Paris Agreement or Paris Agreement is an agreement in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) or Framework of the United Nations Convention on Climate Change. The Paris Agreement draft was agreed at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP) in Paris, France, on November 30-December 12, 2015. In Paris Agreement, countries in it committed to mitigating emissions by reducing House Gas Glass (GHG), conducting adaptation and financing related to climate change mitigation, starts in 2020. Indonesia is also committed to Paris Agreement by submitting Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) documents. Indonesia then ratified the Paris Agreement by issuing Law No. 16 of 2016 concerning Ratification of the Paris Agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change dated October 24, 2016. This ratification was carried out before the 22nd COP was held in Marrakech, Morocco, on November 7-18 2016 Paris Agreement contains a global agreement to keep the earth's temperature below 2 degrees Celsius and a global commitment to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in order to maintain the earth's temperature. By ratifying the Paris Agreement, Indonesia then replaces the INDC document with the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) document to the UNFCCC secretariat. The NDC Indonesia contains a commitment to reduce GHG emissions by 29 percent by 2030 by self-employment, and up to 41 percent with international assistance. While for GHG reduction, Indonesia has committed to implementing it since ratifying the Kyoto Protocol which was an agreement at the 3rd COP in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997. The GHG emission reduction commitment is stated in Presidential Regulation No. 61/2011 concerning National GHG Action Plans (RAN-GRK ) dated October 28, 2011. In the RAN GRK there is a policy framework for the central and regional governments as well as for businesses, communities and other stakeholders to reduce GHG emissions by 26 percent from 2010 to 2020 (before the Paris Agreement comes into force), or 41 percent with international assistance.",

      "abstract": "Concrete structure needs an inspection to prevent structural failures. In concrete inspection activity, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is one of the tools used to detect the location of steel reinforcement in concrete without the need for invasive action. In this paper, GPR for concrete inspection application is designed using frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) and works on ISM bands with a frequency range of 2.4 – 2.5 GHz. Based on radar cross section value and total loss value, a calculation is performed using the radar equation to find the total gain required by the system. The total gain value required by the GPR system with 1-meter detection capability is 11.066 dB and the total gain requirement can be fulfilled using an antenna and low noise amplifier. Meanwhile, the total gain value required by the GPR system with 3-meter detection capability is 165.79 dB. In this research the RX and TX antenna beamwidth specification was calculated. The RX antenna is expected to meet 2.86o – 48.45o beamwidth specifications for 1-meter detection capability and 0.95o – 17.6o beamwidth specifications for 3-meter detection capability. The TX antenna is expected to meet 90o – 126.87o beamwidth specifications for 1-meter and 3-meter GPR detection capability. The GPR FMCW system designed in this paper uses Lime SDR as a transceiver module.",

The aim of the current work is to look into the issue of the surfactant chain length of C8 and C12 to the particle size formation. Two different types of surfactant respectively Sodium Octyl Sulphate (SOS) and Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate (SDS) were brought into an object of investigation. The attachment of such molecule chain length is responsible for the particle size growth rate. It was found that the average particle size of PANi decreased gradually by the addition of SOS and SDS surfactants with 1 % concentration each. The particles of PANi with sizes 296 nm and 191 nm were obtained as analyzed by Particle Size Analyzer (PSA). These sizes are far below 724 nm that obtained from the same reaction but with surfactant-free. Other supporting indicators showed that the pH of polymer being slightly more acidic with a pH value ranges within 0.7 – 1.4 when the surfactant presence during the reaction. The temperature of solution increased with time following the released energy of oxidation agent reaching 30-310C within the first 30 minutes reaction time. When, no surfactant presence in the solution, the temperature of the solution reached 38 0C within 10 minutes reaction time.",

It is an emerging trend in these industries to utilize polypropylene reinforced with natural fiber as the alternative lightweight material. PP-natural fiber composite is projected to have market growth with compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.5% within 2018-2025. Blending PP with natural fiber is a challenging process considering these two materials are not compatible enough to produce composite with desired mechanical properties. Prior treatment to the fiber is required to improve its compatibility with PP with cautionary that it does not degrading the mechanical strength of the fiber. The aim of this work was to study the effect of chemical treatment on Kenaf fiber to the tensile strength of the fiber. Kenaf fiber was bleached with NaClO solution at various concentration (1-10% v/w), temperature (25-55oC), and duration (1-6 hours). The effect of bleaching treatment to the chemical structure and the tensile strength of the fiber was analyzed using FTIR and UTM respectively., This study showed that the fiber with highest tensile strength was the one that treated with NaClO solution with concentration 1% v/w, at 25oC for 1 hour. This treatment removed impurities for the surface and reduced some amorphous part of the fiber. However further increasing NaClO concentration, mixing temperature and duration will damage the cellulose chain in Kenaf fiber which will decrease the mechanical strength of the fiber.",

      "abstract": "Electric bicycles are one of the two-wheeled transportation that has been widely used. The structure of the bicycle is generally composed of several components, one of which is the frame. The frame serves to support the load on the bicycle. At present, many changes in design, geometry and bicycle-forming materials have been carried out. In general, bicycle frames are made of metal and alloy because they have good strength to support the load of the driver. Lately, the use of composites has begun to develop as a bicycle frame material, because the frame of the bicycle has become lighter but still has the strength to support the load. This paper presents a study of the structure of electric bicycles using composite material based on epoxy matrices with rami fiber reinforcement. This study used an experimental and simulation method by designing composite laminates with 90o and 45o fiber webbing layout and then carried out free compressive strength (UCS), optical microscopy and simulation using ANSYS 19.0 software. The results obtained are composite laminate design with fiber webbing layout (45º/45º/45º) having the highest strength value with compressive stress value s = 58.64 MPa and strain e = 0.0586 in the axial compressive plane, and in the tangential press field has the highest compressive stress value s = 1.539 MPa and strain e = 0.1185. While the simulation results obtained composite with lamiation (45º/45º /45º) has the highest compressive stress value with a value of voltage ss = 58,72MPa and simulation strain es = 0,0735 in the axial compressive plane, while the simulated compressive stress value in the press field tangential obtained ss = 1.531 MPa and strain value es = 0.1176.",

The technique is applied by varying the position and ratio of the added mass to the total mass of solar panel, m/mp (%). The added mass position is varied from the axis point up to the end point of the solar panel. The solar panel orientation is influenced by the moving mass position. The oscillation in solar panel caused by the moving mass is eliminated by adjusting the equivalent damping torque cτ, and the solar panel maximum orientation is varied by changing the equivalent torsion spring kτ. The simulation results showed that the solar panel orientation changed from 00 to 60,630 for parameter values m/mp = 15%, r/0,5rt = 35%, cτ = 3 Nm/rad/sec and kτ = 1 Nm/rad. The ability of the system to control the orientation and ratio of m/mp dan r/0,5rt is effective to reduce energy consumption of the solar panel orientation controlling system.",

Membrane emulsification is a fairly novel technique for preparation of various types of emulsions, which relies on the dispersed phase passing through a membrane in order to effect droplet formation. In this study, we have prepared polymeric nanoparticles of different morphologies using self-assembly of asymmetric block copolymers in connection with membrane emulsification. Shirasu Porous Glass (SPG) membranes has been employed as the membrane emulsification equipment, and poly(oligoethylene glycol acrylate)-block-poly(styrene) (POEGA-b-PSt) copolymers prepared via RAFT polymerization. It has been found that a number of different morphologies can be achieved using this novel technique, including spheres, rods, and vesicles. Interestingly, the results have shown that the morphology can be controlled not only by adjusting experimental parameters specific to the membrane emulsification step such as membrane pore size and pressure, but also by changing the nature of organic solvent. As such, this method provides a novel route to these interesting nano-objects, with interesting prospects in terms of exercising morphology control without altering the nature of the block copolymer itself.",

The energy is continued for a prime mover of 200 kW with a BLDC motor, 15 kW air conditioning, 7.5 kW hydraulic power steering, 4 kW compressor for braking systems, each with an induction motor, and 2400 watts for other accessories. Analysis of power consumption for this electric bus, power efficiency in intervals of 65% to 80%, torque efficiency in 75% to 82.5% intervals, and relatively constant and small steering power load on the main motor., , In this paper, several types of steering, manual steering, hydraulic power steering, and electric power steering will be presented. This model will explain what components are involved in a steering system. Data collection on the steering system on large-scale buses is also carried out, to ensure that electric power steering is not available on this type of bus. The bus that will collect the data from the type of chassis used includes the type of bus with an internal combustion engine and also the electric bus currently available. In EV-Bus Molina UI uses a type of hydraulic power steering that will be converted to electric power steering., , The components are directly involved in electric power steering including wheel drive, steering column, rack and pinion gear, motor booster, drag link, tie rod, knuckle, kingpin, tire and so on. The real difference between the city car and the large bus is the long distance from the steering column and front axle, which is as far as 2380 mm, which is about twice that of the city car. Then the link drag structure must be made in such a way as to produce a kinematic mechanism. Then it is necessary to do kinematic analysis and make the equivalent rigidity matrix first to be able to make equations of motion in the steering system as in the electric power steering in city cars",

However, lignin content on oil palm empty fruit bunch can hinder the access of cellulose and hemicelluloses during the hydrolysis process. Therefore, effective pretreatment for delignification of lignocelluloses biomass should be considered to reduce the lignin content. In this study, delignification of oil palm empty fruit bunch has been observed by using peracetic acid solution and alkaline peroxide solution combined with ultrasound method. This study was observed by using peracetic acid pretreatment at 35 oC for 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 hours, followed by alkaline peroxide pretreatment at 35 oC for 10 hours. All pretreatment was conducted by using ultrasound method. Based on results, the lowest lignin content of 8.6% have been achieved by using peracetic acid pretreatment for 3 hours followed by alkaline peroxide pretreatment for 10 hours. From this pretreatment, lignin content was reduced of 68.73% and cellulose content was increased of 121.85%, relative to the untreated biomass. This result was considered as the optimum condition, since the time of pretreatment was reduced and high cellulose content and also low lignin content was achieved which will improve hydrolysis process.",

      "abstract": "Well-being is a positive mental and physical condition of an individual in their life. One of the ways to trigger and fulfill the need of such a condition is through public spaces, which function as a place for people with diverse backgrounds to gather, interact, and do various activities. This paper aims to look on the decline in the role of public space to increase citizens’ well-being through the activities taking place there. To understand how the engagement and well-being of its users work in public spaces, the author examines primary and secondary activities, and uses the active — passive engagement approach and the Five Ways to Well-being. Many types of research related to the quality of public spaces have been done, but they mostly discuss their technical performance instead of the relation to their users. To analyze this phenomenon, the author uses Suropati Park as the object of observation. The methods used to gather data are analyzing photos, mapping the area, and observing the place actively. Findings show that Suropati Park as a public space can meet the criteria as a place with a good impact on the quality of life through its features and elements. Suropati Park can generate the activities that support the well-being of its users, which can be seen through the occurrence of various types of active and passive activities carried out individually or in groups.",

      "abstract": "Many factors have influenced the livability of a city; one of them is a pleasant environment (Rahman et al., 2014). By examining the activities and the points of reference in public spaces as well as their influence on the visitors’ behaviors, this paper aims to explore pleasurable experience in public spaces as a potential way to create easy and exciting wayfinding schemes for the visitors. Much research about wayfinding has been conducted, which mainly talks about its efficiency as observed through various aspects. Previous studies regarding pleasurable experience in wayfinding are also available, but they are relatively scarce and none of them has included a comprehensive discussion on how pleasurable experience can aid wayfinding in public spaces. The methods employed for analysis are based on the theories of Passini (1992), Costello and Edmonds (2007), and Berlyne (1971). The data are collected through active observation, mapping, and picture taking at the Jakarta Old Town (also known as Kota Tua Jakarta) on the weekends, when public activity is the most frequent. This paper reveals that the pleasurable experience that helps the visitors’ wayfinding is mostly derived from the visual aspects involving human activities. These visual aspects provide positive feedback to the visitors, such as the constructed meaning to a related place by stimulating captivation and sensation of the involved subjects.",

      "abstract": "A brand cannot be created without a context of consumers. People need to interact with the brand to create the brand itself. The interaction through communication between consumers and a brand is called brand contacts. Brand contacts that are repeated and then received in people's minds create a different image for each person. That image contributes to the establishment of a public place brand and determines an individual’s perception and perspective towards the brand. For a brand contact to occur, it needs a vehicle called brand contact attributes to accommodate the interaction between the consumers and the brand. This paper aims to explore and reveal people's responses towards brand contact attributes in a public space. Kano's model and I-S model were used as a tool to examine the differences between brand contact attributes in a public place. These models utilize fulfillment, satisfaction, and importance value to assess the brand contact attributes. Lapangan Banteng Park, located in Central Jakarta, was chosen as a site for the study. The attributes that involve possible physical contact in Lapangan Banteng Park were categorized into five quality attributes based on Kano's model. The I-S model determines the character and quality of the attributes and recommends a basis for further action as required by the specific attributes of a public place. The results show that there are brand contact attributes in Kano’s model categories that may be placed differently in the I-S model quadrant.",

The number of surviving traditional buildings was 19 houses as the representative numbers both lowland and upland areas with 71 occupants as the respondents. The thermometer and sound level meter were set at occupant reference height and used to obtain the simultaneously results with an interview. The result highlighted that psychologically, the environment conditions result in accumulative effects on votes, different altitudes and urban growth results in different thermal votes and noise preference. The occupant indices are not significant factors. However, males are the most sensitive in higher conditions and females have the lowest noise preference for comfort. \"The close the opening\" is the most frequently used as a passive method for noise control while it is also flexible in combining with heat control.",

Because streetscape is a fundamental part of the urban physical elements, it can be improved for urban livability. Streetscape livability can be observed in two ways, which are measuring and experiencing. This paper uses the second method, in which it focuses on experiencing the streetscape instead of measuring it. The aim of this paper is to identify the role of the streetscape in supporting urban livability. In this paper, the concept of 5 km/h architecture is introduced to investigate the quality of streetscape experience. Online questionnaires, field observations, and descriptive analysis are employed as research methods. The case study is conducted by doing observation and data retrieval at Haji Amat I Street at Kukusan Teknik, Depok. This paper reveals that the region’s large openings and small proportions have a significant contribution in providing experience and quality to the pedestrians that pass through it, particularly at the commercial food buildings in the area. Both the large openings and the small proportions are mutually sustainable in enriching the quality of human experience, especially the visual experience of the streetscape. Through the transparency and scale variables in the 5 km/h concept, the large openings and the small proportions are indicators of the quality of experience that provide useful evidence as well as guidance to improve urban livability in this particular region.",

In this research, 0.25 wt% & 0,35 wt% of Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) were mixed with Tungtec 10112 powders. in ethanol solution. Dispersion is done through ultrasonication method with SDS solution. The mixture was coated using the flame spraying process onto tool steel substrate. And the coating surface microstructures were observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used for phase identification . The wear rate was observed using ogoshi machine according to ASTM E384 standard and the microhardness was measured by vickers indentation. Effects of CNTs on the surface material microstructure and surface mechanical properties were investigated. The Ultrasonication using SDS solution and ball-milling was suitable to disperse CNTs with WC Tungtec 10112 feed powders since it produces an adequate relationship between CNTs' and WC Tungtec 10112 which enhances surface mechanical properties of coatings. The 0,35 wt% CNT-WC coating showed an increase in wear resistance of almost 50% compared with WC coating without CNT reinforced, The hardness of coating reinforced CNT is increased compared to the WC coating and substrate. Results showed that MWCNT-WC coating increased microhardness and decreased wear rate. Microhardness increased from 550 HV to 1717 HV and wear rate decreased from 0.86 mm3/min to 0.017 mm3/min. This results indicate that CNTs are a good alternative to improve surface mechanical properties of WC coatings.",

The delamination defect has been the high resulted on drilling using drill 10 mm in wet or dry condition. In contrast, delamination defect has occurred minimum on drilling hole using twist drill 8mm in work wet and dry condition it has still occurred. From this research, combination sequence of basalt and carbon fiber has possibility to experience the delaminate damage in dry drilling processes.",

Carbon used in this study is a carbon activated process so that activated carbon is obtained with high pore size. The addition of activated carbon to the LTO is done during the sol-gel process, while the addition of SiOC to LTO-C is performed during the slurry making process. SEM-EDS shows the extent of the elements in the sample where Ti, F, Si, O, and C are present. Also, SEM-EDS characterization also shows an increase in the amount of carbon in each sample. XRD shows the presence of LTO spinel phase and impurity phases such as TiO2 rutile and anatase, and Li2TiO3. In EIS performance testing, low resistivity expresses high conductivity. In this research, high conductivity is owned by LTO-1% C/SiOC. In addition, CV and CD performance tests were performed where the highest specific capacity was obtained in the LTO-5%/SiOC samples",

Displacing the minutiae from its place methodically transforms the fingerprint appearance into a camouflage look. This condition will deceive impostor from obtaining a correct fingerprint data. Implementing some matrix procedures into fingerprint matrix form would change each value contained in the fingerprint. This paper proposes a matrix operation called Kronecker Product Operation (KPO) to manipulate the value of each pixel of the fingerprint feature. KPO agitates each pixel by expanding its value into ixj orde of each pixel. This elaboration transforms the original form of the fingerprint feature image into mxn time of its originality form. For instance, an original 3x3 image would alter into 6x12, 9x21, 15x3, or 24x18 image form depended on KP form used. These form will secure the basic feature information of the fingerprint. Moreover, the protection system is also provided by twirling the row element of the fingerprint pixel by implementing a matrix operation called as elementary row operation (ERO). This procedure works in pixel procedure with some requirements i.e. exchanging rows, multiplying, and zeroing a selected pixel row. These requirements are implemented to distinguish the original feature information of the fingerprint so that any imposter could steal it. The result of this system is a robust fingerprint protection system that guarantees any fingerprint database users to have a secure fingerprint feature.",

A village in Pulau Seram stands firm in the middle of society inhabiting an area which begins to evolve into urban area. The society’s tradition lives throughout the village territory and strongly influences the villagers living space, making these villagers seem to be undisturbed by the modernization amid its existence. Take numa Posune—a place of seclusion for women on periods—as an example. Women in their period are considered impure to the villagers. This belief encourages a taboo to appear, as for men are not allowed to make contact, both visual and physical, to period women, otherwise the men will get sick. This shows how in society that still holds a strong tradition, taboo controls the society’s life until now. This paper discusses settlement pattern formed as an effect of taboo and the role of taboo as a social control in rural contexts. The method of this study was exploring Kampung Rohua's life directly and seeing the role of taboo towards Kampung Rohua. Taboo strongly characterized the settlement and the main key of the spatial configuration. The organization of community live strongly follow their fear of opposing the existing taboos. Taboo also affects society up to their daily activities especially those that are spatially related in the settlements. The findings shows that taboo strongly influenced the formation of space in a traditional rural settlement, in this case in Kampung Rohua.",

The result showed that the 2G is classified as Dogs and has been in the decline phase of the technology life cycle. From a technical point of view, we forecasted and showed that the 2G traffic decreases following S-Curve model and remaining only 2% of the traffic in December 2019. This suggested MNO and regulator to prepare some procedures to terminate the 2G. Moreover, we proposed a strategy for the 2G termination based on busy hour traffic and spectrum re-farming that could be implemented in a cell.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Universitas Indonesia has developed an electric bus (EV-BUS) with an energy source from the main 384 VDC 300 AH battery and a 25.8 VDC 100 AH secondary battery. The energy is continued for a prime mover of 200 kW with a BLDC motor, 15 kW air conditioning, 7.5 kW hydraulic power steering, 4 kW compressor for braking systems, each with an induction motor, and 2400 watts for other accessories. Analysis of power consumption for this electric bus, power efficiency in intervals of 65% to 80%, torque efficiency in 75% to 82.5% intervals, and relatively constant and small steering power load on the main motor., , In this paper, several types of steering, manual steering, hydraulic power steering, and electric power steering will be presented. This model will explain what components are involved in a steering system. Data collection on the steering system on large-scale buses is also carried out, to ensure that electric power steering is not available on this type of bus. The bus that will collect the data from the type of chassis used includes the type of bus with an internal combustion engine and also the electric bus currently available. In EV-Bus Molina UI uses a type of hydraulic power steering that will be converted to electric power steering., , The components are directly involved in electric power steering including wheel drive, steering column, rack and pinion gear, motor booster, drag link, tie rod, knuckle, kingpin, tire and so on. The real difference between the city car and the large bus is the long distance from the steering column and front axle, which is as far as 2380 mm, which is about two to three times that of the city car. Then the link drag structure must be made in such a way as to produce a kinematic mechanism. Then it is necessary to do kinematic analysis and make the equivalent rigidity matrix first to be able to make equations of motion in the steering system as in the electric power steering in city cars",

      "abstract": "Micro-fibrillated celluloses (MFCs) are made from oil palm empty fruit bunches (EFB). EFB is processed through several stages of the process including washing, alkalization, and bleaching to remove impurities, lignin, and hemicellulose. Each treatment stage was characterized by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis. Morphological analysis was characterized using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The process results show that MFC has an average length and thickness of 450 and 80 microns for coarse fibers respectively, averaging 50 and 5 microns for fine fibers, respectively. Fibrillation fibers appear on the surface of fibers which are treated using alkalization and bleaching processes. The TGA results showed a decrease in weight occurred at a temperature of 40 to 109 ° C for the first stage of the heating process and at a temperature of 247 to 382 ° C for the second stage. The decrease in fiber weight is caused by evaporation of water content and degradation of cellulose compounds at each stage. The glass transition temperature of MFC was obtained at 236 ° C. The thermal stability of cellulose from fibers treated using alkalization and bleaching processes proved the formation of cellulose crystals. Removal of lignin and hemicellulose is shown by the absorption of O-H and C-C bonds in FTIR spectroscopy. From these results, it is stated that micro-fibrillation cellulose is formed well through a series of processes given.",

The 6-DoF is considered able to represent the actual conditions because the turbine rotation is the result of post -processing so that the physical phenomenon can be visualized precision. The turbulent model k-ɛ is used to predict the turbulent flow that will occur. Based on the results, the mesh number is 4402703 elements and the time step is 0.001 s which has an error below 3%. Furthermore, the visualization of pressure contour and streamline velocity are similar to the previous study. Pressure and flow pattern of water after passing runners are decreasing and swirling (vortex). Thus, the 6-DOF feature can be an alternative for OFT simulation.",

      "abstract": "Measuring and reporting Cost of Quality is the first step in a quality management program. COQ information can be used to identify key opportunities for corrective actions and provide incentives to make quality improvements. The calculation of quality costs includes the accumulation of conformation and non-conformation costs. Conformational costs are costs incurred to prevent the occurrence of poor quality and nonconformation costs are costs of poor quality caused by poor quality caused by failed or defect products. Cost of quality calculations at PT Griyaton Indonesia involves costs that occured in 2017 and 2018, namely prevention costs, appraisal costs, internal failure costs and external failure costs. From the results of calculations using COQ, it was shown that the cost of failure in 2017 was 69% and in 2018 was 63 % of the total cost of quality, so management must immediately anticipate it by repairing products. Decreasing the rework activity or product defects of PT Griyaton Indonesia requires corrective actions on the quality of the products produced. Method 5 Why Analysis is used to trace and find out the causes of failures that occured in the production process. Based on the product defect analysis, loose concrete is a critical type of defect in the production of precast panel concrete, so mold inspection activities are needed, especially periodically at the joint sections, adding special inspectors to supervise the concrete mold making process, and replacing the use of sealent with sponge because it facilitates inspection and reduces the possibility of mold leaks",

The austenitic stainless steel identified to have a crystal structure of face centered cubic (FCC) with lattice parameter a = 3.59 Å. Similar crystal structure remains to be found in the austenitic stainless steel after arc plasma sintering (APS) for 2 seconds. The lattice parameter of face centered cubic structure for the austenitic steel after APS is a = 3.60 Å. As a comparison, there were also neutron diffraction measurements and the microstructure observations by using an Optical Microscope (MO) and a Electron Microscope (SEM). Assuming the same condition of the casting process, both the A2 ASSs have similar cast structures; the grain boundary formed in A2 ASS as-cast, is thinner than the grain boundary in A2 ASS after APS for 2 seconds which tends to be very visible in its boundaries. While the grain pattern in A2 ASS after APS for 2 seconds, that originally elongated particles changed to be globular particles at the grain structure. Likewise, granular precipitates are very concentrated encompassing the steel matrix granules along the grain boundaries. Observation of SEM-EDX shows that: precipitates in both the A2 ASS are spread out at the grain boundaries (islands) and in the grains (particles). The precipitate compositions in A2 ASS are namely C, Cr, Fe, and Ni. It is possible because the content of the element Cr and element C is dominant so that the chrome carbide of Cr23C6 precipitate is formed at the grain boundaries.",

The austenite grain size influences the microstructure and properties of steel significantly, in which fine austenite grain size leads to higher strength, better ductility, and higher toughness. Studying behavior of steel grain growth during reheating process is still being an interesting subject. P.R.

In this research behavior of austenite grain growth at a high niobium-low carbon (High Nb-low C) and low Nb-high C HSLA steel was evaluated and the result was compared with other investigation. The results found that the austenite grain growth at a low Nb-high C steel was slower than the growth at a high Nb-low C steel.

Experimental results showed that the effectiveness of coagulation increased with the addition of a coagulant dose until the optimal dose is reached at 300 ppm. The similar phenomena with Trans Membrane Pressure (TMP) in the UF process which showed an increase in effectiveness to 1 bar, and the rejection rate decreased as TMP across the UF membrane increased. The lowest concentrations of TSS, turbidity, TDS, COD and BOD in the final product of processed water after RO process were 0 mg/L, 0 FAU, 3.0 mg/L, 9.8 mg/L and 16 mg/L, respectively, which are far below the government regulation so that it can be disposed directly into the river.",

      "abstract": "In the maritime world now, the shipbuilding industry has been very competitive. to develop or even survive in global market competition, shipbuilders need to find methods to efficiently produce ships in order to renew energy in the shipbuilding business and stabilize shipbuilding costs. Therefore, the development of new methods like ship building modules, optimization design, and modularization concepts is necessary. this paper presents a new approach to the design of piping systems on engine room in ships based on the concept of Rule Based algorithms. The characteristics of the proposed method are as follows. First, Attention is given to piping systems from several different piping systems. similarity of modules and settings considered and costs and size of piping systems and similarities. Second, the design process of the piping system will be divided into two stages: module definition and design development. Third, to define effective modules that can be used in general on different ships, the design structure matrix is adopted. And fourth, In the design of the development, the optimization system was developed using a Rule Based algorithm to obtain the same pattern in the development of modules on several piping systems on ships with special consideration of costs and similarities. This study discusses the details of the method outlined above. In addition, the ship piping system is designed using the proposed method and its effectiveness is evaluated to achieve efficiency.",

While the transportation utility such as pedestrian path only considered as supporting component. Even though walking is a form of basic transportation and the only way to changing the mode of transportation in the transit area and connected by walking distance is one of the parameters to a successful transit-oriented development area. This study meant to analyze the connection between walking components or aspects of pedestrian path influence the rate of use from public transit transportation. The scope of this study is pedestrian lanes connecting Duren Kalibata Train Station and Kalibata City Apartment. Based on the literature study, this research was using trip distance, sidewalk width, obstacles, and path discontinuity as components of the pedestrian path that influences transit transportation rate of use. Survey counting, observation, and measurement were used to collect data. These data analyzed using multiple linear regression. Components from the pedestrian path from literature study used as an independent variable: trip distance (X1), sidewalk width (X2), obstacles (X3), and path discontinuity (X4). Equation model Y=-0.575-0.021(X1)+4.825(X2)-0.164(X3)+2.154(X4) is a result of data analysis for public transit transportation rate of use at Duren Kalibata Train Station. From the ANOVA regression test, this equation model has variables with low significance. And from the t-stat value test, it shows that only trip distance that has a big influence on public transit transportation rate of use at Duren Kalibata Train Station. To formulate a better model that represents the condition on how pedestrian path influences the usage rate of transit transportation, trip distance can be used and combined with other pedestrian path components that will need to be identified.",

      "abstract": "Owing to the high strength to its weight ratio and excellent corrosion resistance, the demand of Ti alloy for structural and automotive application is kept on increasing. Thus, the development of this alloy to supply the demand is continuously proposed and conducted. Microstructural design is generally applied to improve the mechanical property of titanium alloy by introducing different phase transformation and thermomechanical treatment. Aside from the martensitic and diffusion transformation, the occurrence of massive transformation also occurs in Ti alloy. Massive transformation is a civilian phase transformation, which resulted in the change of crystal structure of an alloy with a given composition, without changing the chemical composition of its initial phase. Massive transformation involves a diffusion and growth mechanism in a short range and generally occurs during the introduction of high cooling rates to restrict the fully diffusion mechanism. Owing to the nature of rapid cooling rate for the presence of massive transformation, the massive phase is normally found together with the product of martensitic transformation. On the other hand, the product of massive transformation is observed as a blocky grain with a featureless characteristic using optical microscopy. It was reported for containing a high dislocation density similar with martensitic transformation. Specifically, in Ti alloy, the higher magnification using scanning electron microscopy shows fine sub-lamellar morphology, which observed as a combination product morphology between martensitic and diffusion transformation. It resulted in the mechanical property of the massive phase is between those two morphologies. Hence, it brings a new perspective on designing the microstructure of Ti alloy, which can be used to improve the mechanical property of Ti alloy.",

Based on the simulations results, the boundary conditions of discharge are 40 and 60 L/s that blade plates produce higher efficiency than aerofoil. This is because the pressure gradient at the leading edge of the blade plate higher than aerofoil. A high gradient pressure on the blade can cause lift force to be high so that the runner’s torque increases. Thus, the plate blade profile is suitable for OFT with pico scale.",

The Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to obtain short path by considering some constraints like number of pipe bends and pipe cross. The method works by generating some candidate paths based on the given paramaters geometrically. The non-geometric paramaters such as material cost and installation cost will also be assesed. Then by using the algorithm, the desire option from various candidate paths will be evaluated. This study discusses the details of the above methods.

At the DME purification plant, the mixture of DME, methanol and air in the feed will be separated to obtain a pure DME of 99% concentration. Model predictive control is used to control the processes in the DME purification plant using first-order plus dead-time models (FOPDT). This study examines the use of MPC technically by comparing it with the control performance of the proportional-integral (PI) controller and analyzed economically. The result, the eight single MPCs (SMPCs) performances are better than the PI controllers in overcoming the disturbance with the decrease of the integral of absolute error (IAE) by 40 % to 96%. Thus, there is a saving of utility (water) used is 0,015%. Since the utility is water, the economic value is low. This led to a considerable payback period (PBP) of 14.5 years, and net present value (NPV) of USD -846 in the feed flowrate disturbance scenario of 5%, so that the use of SMPC in the DME purification plant is economically unfeasible. However, the use of two multivariable MPCs (MMPCs) instead of the eight SMPCs will decrease the PBP and will increase the NPV, therefore, the use of MMPC can be considered for further research.",

This project has a capacity of 4MW/8MWh that uses Lithium-ion batteries (LiB). The BESS uses eight (8) LiBs with an energy capacity of 1-MWh each. Two batteries are connected to one PCS (ES-PCS connection), each with a 1-MW power output capacity. The ES-PCS configuration being controlled by the PMS is connected to the grid thru a step up transformer (380V/20 kV). As of this writing, the BESS has two fully functional applications as controlled by the PMS, load leveling, Frequency Regulation and wind power smoothing",

      "abstract": "Increase as much as 87oC every year. Nowadays, 90% of the transportation for industry is done by sea. There are two components sharing the most vital role in sea transportation, i.e. ships and ports. This research focused on the calculation of the emissions in the whole process in the ports, which covered berthing, the unloading processes, transfer from piers to stacking spots, stacking and vice-versa. The methodology of this research involved collecting the data of the ports' performances for one year, which covered berthing, equipment and utility, fuel consumption, and electricity. The researched ports was Belawan International Container Terminal (BICT). The emission factor used for fuel was based on the policy issued by the Ministry of Environment that has ratified IPCC 2006, and, as for the electricity, the emission factor of the Jawa Madura Bali power plant was used, i.e. 0.844 kg of CO2/KWH. It was found out that the fewest emissions in terms of the emissions from the whole equipment were those in BICT, as many as 15.93 kg of CO2/teus. As for the emissions produced by fuel or direct emissions in a port, those in BICT as many as 15.38 kg of CO2/teus. In respect of the emissions from the whole process in a port, from berthing to taking containers out of the port, the emissions in JICT as many as 29.08 kg of CO2/teus. A huge number of emissions were produced from berthing. With the use of power on shore, this number will shrink, and it will eventually considerably lessen the number of the whole emissions in the port.",

      "abstract": "The port sector has been playing one of the important roles in global trade as ports are one of the transportational chain-rings in building environmental-social performance. As we all know, the usage of means of transportation are spreading further across the world. Starting with the Kyoto Protocol for ships, the environmentally friendly trend has also drawn in the port sector. However, it is difficult to find a model with the same characteristics as those of the ports as the models. The models can be used to compare the operational performances in the aspect of CO2 emission production. On that basis, this research aimed at estimating the CO2 emissions in container ports in order to portray how a port deals with its operational matters using models suitable for ideal circumstances based on the available equipment. This calculative system applies the bottom-up calculation of the work activities done in the ports, of the amount of fuel consumption, not as an input variable, but as the result of the calculation of the calculation itself. As for the input variables, they are the throughput, transshipment process, transportational modality and terminal layout. The result shows that several equipment operational activities can be optimized by comparing the results of the calculation of the CO2 actual emissions. In this research, it was found that each TEUS produced CO2 emissions as many as 12,21 kg in BICT, after calculating the emissions which had either direct or indirect effects. Then, the result of the calculation of only the CO2 emissions which had direct effects on the ports, i.e. the emissions of non-electrically operated equipment, was each TEUS produced as many as 12,21 kg in BICT,. This research is potentially of considerable use to ports since it shows how to calculate CO2 emissions in a port under ideal circumstances, the used models can adapt to the characteristics of any port, and the data serving as the input variables are not difficult to get.",

X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Raman spectroscopy confirmed successful synthesis of the nanocomposites. Square wave voltammetry (SWV) was performed using a portable potentiostat (CheapStatTM) and a three-electrode setup in order to determine the electrochemical behavior of the nanocomposite and its interaction with malathion. Maximum inhibition was observed at conditions corresponding to 15% rGO loading, pH 4 buffer solution, and five-minute accumulation time. Calibration of the sensor established a linear detection range of 0.5-8 ppm malathion, with a detection limit of 0.992 ± 0.007 ppm. The parameters indicate good selectivity in detection and potential applicability of the system for measuring malathion particularly in agricultural produce which falls within the detection range identified.",

Unfortunately, those methods encounter several pitfalls, such as inquiry for subject’s consciousness, heavy computational resources, and falsification risk. We propose gait analysis as a complementary complement for biometric surveillances approach due to its accuracy in distinguishing two different persons. Using a Kinect™ device, gait analyses are expected to be low-cost and easy to use. During the experiment 2 male subjects in the age of 24-26 were involved. One of them was in the normal weight category, while the other was overweight. The subjects were asked to walk on a 2.4-m aisle towards the device 5 times. Next, the recorded images are interpreted into the joint positions of each subject for each frame using a Dump Kinect Skeleton software into Cartesian coordinates for each joint. However, we were only focused on the 5 joints in the axial skeleton. The analysis of variance (Anova) results showed that the movements of base spine, middle spine, and shoulder spine were similar within a subject, indicating the validity of the Kinect™. Subsequently, the movements of the 3 joints from Subject 1 and Subject 2 were compared. The t-test results showed that the gait of Subject 1 and Subject 2 were significantly different. It means that the device can distinguish 2 different persons through their gait. These results also indicated that a Kinect™ device can be further developed into gait-based surveillance tool.",

It is very common sight, as the elevated urban infrastructures in public space constructed, some residual spaces subsequently appear; consumed and owned by no one but the public— which what de Solà-Morales describes as the “terrain vague” (1985) or “superfluous landscape” according to Nielsen (2002). The residual spaces beneath these pedestrian bridges connotes freedom and opportunity for engagements. As the residual spaces are open to free way of perceiving, it provides potential outlets for unexpected and informal events.

This heat transfer rate on the air side can be improved by increasing the heat transfer coefficient. One way to increase the heat transfer coefficient on the air side is to use a vortex generator (VG), which can generate longitudinal vortex (LV) increasing fluid mixing. Therefore, this study aims to numerically analyze heat transfer characteristics and pressure drop of airflow through a heated plate by installing VG in a rectangular channel. Vortex generators (VGs) used in numerical modeling are rectangular winglet pairs (RWPs) and concave rectangular winglet pairs (CRWPs) with 30° attack angle. The number of pairs of VG is varied by one, two, and three with/without holes. The velocity of airflow varies in the range of 0.4-2.0 m/s at intervals of 0.2 m/s. The simulation results show that in the configuration of the three pairs of VG, the decrease in the convection heat transfer coefficient in the case of the perforated CRWP is 3.98% of the CRWP without holes at a velocity of 2.0 m/s. While in the configuration of three pairs of perforated RWP VGs, the decrease in convection heat transfer coefficient is 5.87% from RWP without holes at a velocity of 2.0 m/s. In the configuration of three pairs of perforated VGs at the highest velocity, the decrease in pressure drop in the CRWP and RWP cases is 30.73% and 13.87% of the VGs without holes, respectively.",

The classical proportional navigation guidance is applied at the directional mode and the lateral mode is consisted mainly of anti-roll algorithm. Skid-to-turn combined with augmented proportional navigation (STT-CAPN) is chosen for directional steering method due to its effectiveness for major missile configurations. The longitudinal mode guidance is improved by incorporating gravitational compensation and target’s forward velocity consideration. Guidance zoning is employed according time-from-launch (TFL) period to counter the impulsive response of the missile in burn-phase and coast-phase. Control strategy used in the longitudinal mode exploits sliding-mode-control (SMC) approach. Simulation results exemplify the decrease of miss distance by decoupling those flight modes",

      "abstract": "Kampung kota or urban village has always been regarded as slum area and in most cases seen as not suitable as residential area. Efforts to evict by the government has always been a major issue. In reality, houses in kampung kota have a concept that is not different from the concept of the Tiny House Movement which has already happened in many countries. For people who live in urban areas, their homes can be considered as tiny houses. The only different is their appearance compared to tiny houses in other countries which have a considerably ‘nicer’ and ‘neater’ design. Living in a tiny house does not only mean living in a small house, but also adapting to a simpler, less consumptive, more connected to nature and caring for the environment. This paper will discuss how tiny houses in kampung kota can actually form a sustainable living. We explore part of Kampung Muka, Ancol, North Jakarta to observe their domestic spaces and conduct in-depth interviews with the residents. Through this investigation, we find that sustainable living had taken place in the life of the residents living in tiny houses in Kampung Muka.",

The development of food distribution lines in a trajectory is significant in in finding new spaces that are potential as social space. The number of stop locations from food distribution will increase, because the trajectory shows how food journey moves to several new locations that have a relationship with the usual distribution locations. The stop locations from food journey in trajectory are Point of Interest (POI). We observe POI development by paying attention to networks and space syntax for food operation and show POI and network development from food trajectory.",

The source distribution along the center plane of the hull was expressed in terms of Green’s function which was the form of Havelock source potential under free surface. In numerical computation, the ‘Tent’ function was also introduced to express the hull form based on offsets data for solving Michell integral problem numerically. Employing the numerical methods developed, the wave-making resistance of the Wigley hull and the traditional fishing vessel of Madura Island in Indonesia was analyzed within several of Froude number. The numerical results had shown significant influences of hull form and speed on the wave making resistance of the ship.",

The academic library, which from the beginning has become a storehouse for information with the collections, now begun to be less attractive for millennial generations due to the influence of information technology. This study aims to compare k-means and x-means clustering method to find out the characteristics of the academic library. Data is collected using questionnaire, both online and offline forms. The total number of responses are 935. The results show that k-means performs better than x means since it results in lower Davies Bouldin index. However, x-means provides better description of the patron behavior on its each cluster. Both k-means and x-means clustering method creates five cluster based on the academic library patron behavior.",

However, there are still limited studies in evaluating the emissions from clean water production and supply sector. This study aimed to calculate CO2 emissions from the sector which includes raw water abstraction, clean water treatment plant (WTP), and clean water distribution by using mathematical models. The calculation was carried out to two water treatment plant in Depok City, Legong and Citayam. CO2 emissions from both WTPs are estimated at 0.49 kg CO2/m3 for WTP Legong and 0.35 kg CO2/m3 for WTP Citayam. Based on the calculation, electricity consumption is the most contributing component to CO2 emissions because the operation of both WTPs require an extensive amount of electricity. This study also revealed that changing the source of electrical power gave the largest reduction in CO2 emissions.",

Indonesia as a disaster-prone country assign disaster social workers under two organizations, namely from the government as National SAR Agency (BASARNAS) and the private sector which oversees the volunteers. Currently, there is a growing concern regarding social workers’ productivity. This concern is due to the nature of disaster workers, which has high exposure to high mental workload and harsh work environment., Therefore, it is important to assess the disaster workers’ condition in terms of cognitive and work stress factor in order to maintain good productivity. Work stress problems are suffered by disaster social workers in Indonesia. The assessment can be used to produce recommendation for handling risk and preventing mental disorders that can affect performance and productivity. Two main factors which are cognitive is assessed as variable of empathy with four sub-scales. Work stress factors are assessed as variables of post-traumatic stress responses (PTSR) and general psychological distress (GPD). These three variables are rated using three types of questionnaires and then evaluated. This study aims to determine relationships of cognitive factor and demographic attributes that have significant effect on work stress factors., There are three types of data analyses performed to support the results of this research. Results show relationship of cognitive between work stress. Finally, research findings can be used as a reference for improvement for both organizational and individual systems. Recommendations are proposed for disaster social workers to increase productivity by anticipating the risk of work stress.",

The Cafeteria of The Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Indonesia (FT UI) is one of the highest contributors of organic waste. The food waste management that was done is only limited to composting, which takes around 6-7 weeks. One of the alternatives that could be used for food waste management is bioconversion which uses the larvae of black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens). The purpose of this study are: to obtain the knowledge regarding the amount of FT UI Cafeteria’s organic waste generation, analyze the ideal duration of the bioconversion, and analyze the bioconversion potential from organic waste. The first step of this study was done in the laboratory scale which uses 4 variations of the bioconversion duration which are 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. The ideal bioconversion duration that was obtained from the second phase of the study which aims to obtain empirical evidence regarding the waste management potential in the existing scale. The results showed that there is an average of 46.27 kg of waste generation per day. From 4 variation of the duration bioconversion, the ideal duration are 12 days. As for the existing waste management potential, the bioconversion could reduce the waste as much as 75% with a WRI of 6.25% per day and also could produce the larva biomass of about 800 grams per 4 kg of waste.",

      "abstract": "Mass rapid transit in Jakarta has created rampant sprawl in the surrounding areas of development. In certain areas, intense planning insures the well-being of the inhabitants by referring to development principles laid out to accommodate communities with high levels of transit. The act of transit is required to fulfill one’s physical or mental needs when remaining in a specific area prevents that from being accomplished. The principles referred to are walkability and intelligibility which - according to Calthrope (1993) - give way to an ideal area development, whereas, areas that develop spontaneously without proper planning frequently become kampungs (urban slums). Kampungs are common around unplanned transit areas because of the need to commute on a daily basis by the working class. Unplanned communities encourage certain lifestyles, such as living in close proximity to transit stations (walkability), and developing a perception of their surroundings (intelligibility). This paper will observe Kampung Muka in North Jakarta and determine if the principles of Transit-Oriented Development (hereinafter, TOD) are applicable to this area. The case study was chosen because of its proximity to major sites in Jakarta, such as Kota Tua, Jakarta Kota Station and Kampung Bandan Station. In this paper, our observations will analyze whether Kampung Muka applies TOD principles on a daily basis. To observe the applications of these principles, methods used include literature and morphological studies of the development, circulation and access, and intelligibility of locals towards the kampung. From these observations, we conclude the incorporation of TOD principles in the daily lives of Kampung Muka’s residents would create an assimilation process aligning their core values with these respective principles.",

This research was aimed to design a cascade straight heat pipe which has better performance for the CPU cooling system without the need of additional power for the operation. The method used in this research was by testing the thermal performance of the cascade straight heat pipe in the provision of heat loads of 10 watts, 20 watts, 30 watts, and 40 watts as the maximum load. The tests were carried out on three types of working fluid (pure water, Al2O3-water nanofluid and Al2O3-TiO2-water hybrid nanofluid). From the data obtained, the best thermal performance was given by cascade straight heat pipe with Al2O3-TiO2-water as the working fluid which decreased the simulator plate temperature to 41,872% at the maximum load, and had the highest condenser output temperature. The second best thermal performance was given by cascade straight heat pipe with Al2O3-water as the working fluid which decreased the simulator plat temperature to 35,243% at the maximum load. The poor thermal performance was given by cascade straight heat pipe with water as the working fluid which decreased only 28,648% of the simulator plate temperature and had the lowest condenser output temperature. Cascade straight heat pipe with the lowest thermal resistance at each heat loading is the use of the working fluid Al2O3-TiO2-water, as well as the heat transfer coefficient possessed by the use of Al2O3-TiO2-water is the highest among the others.",

Electrophoretic Deposition (EPD), one of coating methods that is widely applied for coating metal because of its simplicity and relatively low cost, is chosen for coating metal implants. HA coating layer quality can be controlled by adjusting applied voltages and coating time of the EPD process. However, the optimum voltage and exposing time has not yet been known for new type titanium implant such as Ti-12Cr and TNTZ. This work is, therefore, focusing on the effect of applied voltage and coating time on the mass growth, HA coating thickness, and surface coverage that can be produced on the surfaces of the both alloys, and also on the conventional titanium alloy, Ti6Al4V, for comparison. Result of this work showed that there is a significant influence of the titanium alloy type on the HA layer performances. However, it is necessary to choose suitable voltage and exposing time for producing sufficient coating layer that meets to the standard of orthopedic implants.",

The existing space injected by their behavior and create value for them to call it place, a place for them. The same way goes for children that occupy the street as their playground. This paper will interrogate the process of children placemaking, how the kampung street turn into a playful and happy place for children. We conduct this research by doing participant observation, playing with children during their free time, and taking visual notes, in order to understand how children occupy the street and add value to the kampung street, a place for them to play.",

      "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the effect of the electrophoretic deposition process (EPD) of natural HA (extracted from bovine bones) with various particle size on Ti-29Nb-13Ta-4.6Zr (TNTZ) coating surfaces. HA particles were refined from bovine bone powders using planetary ball mill and then sieving to separate the particle based on its size. The maximum size according to sieving mesh size is #25 µm, #63 µm and #125 µm. The coating process was conducted by using EPD apparatus with voltage and time process 10V and 5 minutes, respectively, for each sample. The coating layer morphology was observed with stereo microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX). The result shows that the size of the particle determines the coating layer characteristics. The best of HA coating quality according to the implant coating standard is obtained for the 25 µm particle size with the surface coverage is 99%. The thickness is 121 µm and the ratio of chemical composition Calcium and Phosphor Ca/P) is 1,49%. These may be concluded that, on the point of view physical characteristics, natural HA from bovine bone has potential enough as a coating layer to improve the bioactivity implant for biomedical application. However, the mechanical characteristic of the layer is still needed to determine the strength of coating layer for avoiding delamination during application.",

      "abstract": "The quality of public space is one of the keys of a sustainable city. In public space it is not easy for people to avoid not to be seen by other people, therefore this inevitable visibility can be used both to create a pressure for people or to improve the quality of public space as Jane Jacob’s idea of eyes on the street. In addition, formal surveillance by local authorities and building owners also play a role in public space. Both visibility and formal surveillance work together with architectural features and to create a sustainable safety mechanism in public space. Visibility and formal surveillance will 'regulate' the space by giving a feeling of controlling the space, and being controlled at the same time. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to find out the relationship between visibility and formal surveillance, as well as their connection to existing architectural features, that resulted in a sustainable safety mechanism in public space. The authors observe Pasar Baru shopping area in the North Jakarta as a case study of public space that uses the concept of eyes on the street initiated by Jane Jacobs. A number of issues will be discussed by linking surveillance with architectural features, how surveillance works in public space, and the effects of surveillance in public space.",

      "abstract": "History and collective memory can be maintained through heritage building conservation, because collective memory is represented through architectural object. It is important to preserve the whole story of the building, the architectural form, and the memory related to the building and the society so that all of those aspects can be passed down to the next generation. The preservation of both tangible and intangible characteristics of heritage building can be one aspect to attain sustainable society and city. When a certain heritage building is physically destroyed, for sure the connection between the building and the collective memory of people for the building and some events related to the building also vanishes and this is an example of heritage terrorism. This paper discusses heritage terrorism in a slightly different context, especially when the building is slowly destroyed, and the memory is attacked. The aim of the paper is to investigate whether there are any linkages between the heritage building terrorism and collective memory of the society. This study appoints Pasar Johar Semarang as a study case, since it is a heritage building that experienced some changes and misfortunes such as fire incident in 2015. In order to do so, this paper will connect some theories on heritage building conservation, collective memory, and heritage terrorism. This paper concludes that Pasar Johar encounters heritage terrorism because the building is slowly damaged by physical intervention and fire incident, therefore causing the collective memory of society for the market disappears.",

      "abstract": "For most engines, e.g production machinery in manufacturing industry or heavy equipment like excavator or dozer, the time for cooling down and dismantling process occurs very rapidly so that spare parts must be ready before maintenance or shutdown activities begin. But for gas turbines, whether it is preventive maintenance or unplanned shut down, the cooling down and dismantling process lasts for a few days and even more than 1 week. This unique characteristic has not been considered in previous studies. An integration model of spare parts inventory and preventive maintenance is proposed. The proposed model will consider the time factor of engine cooling down and dismantling. By using just-in-time delivery, the spare parts arrive after the completion of engine cooling down and dismantling period. This model will imitate the situation and condition of a power generation company in Indonesia. Discrete-event simulations (DES) are carried out using the company's operation, maintenance, inventory, and logistics historical data. The results of the DES simulation and data processing with formulas and commercial data are optimized by linear programming methods and response surface methodology (RSM). By incorporating the stochastic characteristic generated by the variations in the duration of cooling down & dismantling, the duration of assembling, and the duration of parts delivery, the application of the proposed model can reduce the duration of spare part inventory in the warehouse which will result to lower storage cost so that it can lead to an increase in the company's profit.",

      "abstract": "Fungal infection is one of the existing diseases in Indonesia. The most common fungal infections are the candidiasis and cryptococcosis disease which is caused by Candida sp. and Cryptococcus sp. fungi respectively. Propolis is known to have antifungal properties to Candida sp. and Cryptococcus sp. However, the compounds contained in propolis differs according to its source; the bee that produces it, and its environment, differentiating also its antifungal potential. Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the potential of Indonesian propolis, specifically from Tetragonula biroi bee as antifungal agent in hopes to discover its ability as candidiasis and cryptococcosis drugs. Methods: The propolis used in the study was Indonesian propolis produced by Tetragonula biroi bee. The antifungal potential of Indonesian propolis was discovered by observing its antifungal activity to a few species of Candida and Cryptococcus and determining its content. Two types of Indonesian propolis, smooth and rough propolis in the form of ethanol extract propolis (EEP) were tested on Candida albicans, C. krusei, C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, and Cryptococcus neoformans with the disc diffusion method. Ethanolic extract of Indonesian propolis is further tested with LC-MS/MS analysis. Results: The content of Indonesian propolis itself in the form of polyphenol and flavonoid is discovered with the help of UV-Vis Spectrometry where it was discovered that smooth propolis has higher phenolic and flavonoid level at 18.32% and 17.45% respectively. Ethanolic extract of Indonesian propolis is further tested with LC-MS/MS procedure which results in the founding of three antifungal compounds. Adhyperforin was found in both rough and smooth propolis, and deoxypodophyllotoxin as well as kurarinone was found only in smooth propolis. Conclusion: Based on our study, Indonesian propolis is proven to have antifungal potential though its effectivity differs from one species of fungi to another where on Candida tropicalis, C. krusei, C.tropicalis, and Candida glabrata, rough propolis shows higher diameter of inhibition.",

      "abstract": "The decreasing of fossil energy resources is inversely proportional to the need of energy. So the research development on alternative energy sources is increasingly carried out, one of which is about biogas production. Coffee pulp waste can be used as a potential biogas source which contained cellulose and hemicellulose aside from that, the waste also contains inhibitors like lignin, caffeine, and tannins. Therefore, pretreatment was performed using alkaline followed by rumen fluid pretreatment. This study aims to reduce the levels of lignin and inhibitors in coffee pulp waste and to find the reaction kinetics in biogas production from coffee pulp waste within 20 days HRT, 30 days HRT, and 35 HRT. First, the coffee pulp waste was prepared and pretreated chemically using 5% v/v H2O2 at 80oC and maintained pH of 11.5 for 6 hours. Then the process was continued with rumen fluid pretreatment by adding 25 mL of rumen fluid per gram substrate. Hereinafter, the pretreated coffee pulp waste was put into a reactor with a working volume of 1,5 L with operating conditions of 37oC with the HRT variables. From the study, the chemical pre-treatment can reduce lignin content till 75%, caffeine content till 57,76%, and decrease tannin till 0,54% also increasing biogas volume from 6,1 L to 10,5 L. The kinetic constants obtained are: k1 (reaction’s kinetic constant) : 0.1967 day-1; k2 (maximum rate of soluble organics production): 351.4 mg SCOD L-1day-1; k3 (saturation constant): 23.174 mg SCOD L-1day-1 ; k4 (maximum rate of soluble organics degradation): 0.1 day-1 ; k5 (saturation constant): 0.5 mg SCOD L-1day-1; k6 (maximum rate of TVA consumption) : 70000 mg TVA-COD L-1day-1 ; and k7 (saturation constant): 300000 mg TVA-COD L-1day-1.",

The vulnerabilities of their existence rely from several drivers according to Wamsler (2008) namely; space-related, infrastructure-related, socio-economic, and institutional. Simultaneously their vulnerabilities is strengthened by communal adaptations as a respond of kampung residents towards their daily pressures especially on clean water availability and sanitation facilities. This paper discusses spatial adaptations done by residents of Kampung Muka, North Jakarta as a respond to clean water provision and sanitation facilities as their basic daily needs. Qualitative methods consist of site observation of community spatial adaptation along with interview with the locals to gain a deeper understanding about the adaptation from their perspectives are used to investigate the community. In order to study about spatial adaptation generally, we employ adaptive cycle which consist of four phases; exploitation, conservation, release, and reorganization. This cycle explain the development of Kampung Muka and how the community adapt to existing environment spatially, from the historical and current point of view. The spatial adaptation done by community of Kampung Muka found to be related with other factors which include social and economic activities. This indicates that urban kampung especially in Jakarta has the potential to be a sustainable community which capable to adapt and exist over the years.",

To the author best knowledge, the method is rather classic but its realibility has not been discussed in the context of a large data size. Priory, the research anticipates that the accuracy is a function of the damage level. In this study, we evaluate 3500 cases with five levels of structural integrity, namely, healthy condition and damaged conditions with 1%, 5%, 10%, and 20% damage levels. The dataset is established via a numerical analysis of a seven degree-of-freedom system loaded with a concentrated dynamic force with random magnitude. A spring on the system is reduced in its stiffness to simulate damages. Our significant findings are the following: it is challenging for the PSD-based method to differentiate the healthy condition from the damaged conditions when the damage level is small. However, the reliability is high at 95% probability when the structural integrity has dropped by five percents.",

      "abstract": "Demand of carbon nanotube (CNT) in Indonesia is increasing every year. Until this time, CNT production and commercialization is constrained by expensive processes. CNT carbon source that is potential because of its low price is liquified petroleum gas (LPG). To realize the CNT production in Indonesia, techno-economic analysis of CNT production from LPG is needed. CNT is produced by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method using Fe-Co-Mo/MgO catalyst. Production is done using fluidized bed reactor equipped by cyclone for separating CNT from residual gas. CNT synthesis in the reactor is done at temperature 900 - 1000oC and atmospheric pressure. CNT purified with HNO3 acid treatment, followed by netralization using H2O and drying. The process produce 99% purity CNTs with capacity 200 – 250 kilograms per year. Argon recovery is applied on the process to reduce argon utilization up to 85%. Whole process requiries up to 210000 kJ/day energy consumption. CNT produced would have IDR 5300 selling price. Economic analysis result shows it have 18.88% on IRR, NPV above IDR 1.2 billion, and less than 5 years on payback period. These values shows that CNT production is a profitable investation and could open opportunity for developing CNT production with low price in Indonesia.",

      "abstract": "Studies regarding recrystallization texture of brass alloys are quite complex. Previous experiments showed that the addition of the alloying elements on brass alloys affect the deformation mechanism and texture development. Alloying elements promoted the inhomogeneous deformation and resulted in heterogeneous microstructure. During annealing, the new grains form around the shear band area and develop the random texture. This research studied the effect of Mn addition on the recrystallization characteristics and texture development of Cu-29Zn alloys. The Cu-Zn-xMn alloys were produced by gravity casting with the dimension of 110x110x6 mm3. The feeding material includes pure Cu, Zn, and Mn. The as-homogenized samples were then cold-rolled with the level of deformation of 70 % and followed by an annealing process at a temperatures of 400, 500, and 600 oC. Samples characterization includes chemical composition analysis, microstructure observation, hardness testing, and texture measurement. The results showed that the addition of Mn tended to reduce the rate of recrystallization and grain growth. At 70% deformation, Mn addition promoted the formation of brass and Goss texture. The presence of Mn also influenced the formation of recrystallization and annealing texture.",

      "abstract": "Public spaces have undergone a transformation, driven by the dominion of capitalism and the world market. As public spaces are now considered an economic commodity, they might appear to have various functions but nevertheless share similarities; packaged, themed, commodified for consumption and meant for entertainment with access based on the ability to pay (Gottdiener, 2001). Meanwhile, according to Dovey (1999), spaces are necessarily programmed and designed in accordance with certain interests, primarily the pursuit of amenity, profit, status and political power. Defined as “control over”, power manifests itself in many forms—one of which is authority. It controls space and its representation combined with control over the user’s behavior as characterized by the absence of arguments and legitimation through legal procedures. This research aims to discuss the commodified public space through its appearance and the existence of authority by using the theory of Production of Space by Lefebvre. This approach was chosen because without the concept of space and its production, the framework of power cannot reach concretism (Lefebvre 1991). The USS Arcade x MoJA Museum in Senayan City Mall, Central Jakarta was selected as the focus of this study. The findings reveal that the physical features of a commodified public space and the existence of authority are reflected in the spatial quality as experienced within the place. Experiencing commodified public space is a leisure, yet such an experience is delivered in a more controlled and profit-oriented way, and it might lead to a shift on its pattern of consumption.",

For damage detection, this research article discusses an easy-to-compute damage index derived from the governing dynamic of the structure that has potential practical application in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). We use simplified structural models to explore the sensitivity of the index to damages, to compare the index performance with a traditional but popular damage detection method, and to understand the local/global predictive capability of the index. We use two simple models, namely, single- and two-degree-of-freedom systems. The results suggest that the damage index is local, that can only monitor damages occurring near the points of measurements, but it is sensitive to damages, unlike the natural frequency, which is global but less sensitive.",

The model considered the effect of the mass and momentum transfers, as well the chemical reaction. The simulation results show that the driving force of the reactive absorption is higher than the ordinary absorption in term of the low concentration of CO2 in the liquid phase. The CO2 concentration in the bulk gas is approximately 7.56 mol/m3. It decreases to around 5.75 mol/m3 after crossing the concentration boundary layer.",

The changes in Bank Indonesia policy to release the loan to value ratio for the purchase of the first house with an area of more than seventy square meters is one of the government's solution to encourage the growth of housing property. This issue is due to the difficulty of the first time home buyer in paying the down payment. The design of this research uses a case study of multiple case holistic design and using qualitative analysis method. Qualitative data was obtained from in-depth interviews with nine housing developers. We found that most developers are willing to change their market segmentation to a lower segment (36 household type) than the previous ones they have set. We concluded that the LTV ratio easing policy cannot help many developers if the macroeconomic conditions are still weak.",

In order to simulate the turbulent flow field, the mass conservation was governed by the continuity equation and the momentum balance was governed by the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equation. The turbulence effect was modeled using the k-ε model. This model added two additional transport equations and two dependent variables, i.e. turbulence kinetic energy (k) and turbulence dissipation energy (ε). Mixture model in COMSOL was used to simulate numerically the mixing of immiscible fluids. The simulation identified the average velocity and the flow pattern of fluid as well as the relative velocity, the shear rate and the volume fraction of the dispersed phase.

This is interesting as the application of WMT has been conducted to reduce the fire disaster risks which were very rare to be implemented in the world. The province of Riau which is about 56% covered with peatlands, is very vulnerable against haze disaster caused by peatlands fires. Peatlands are fragile ecosystems formed over thousands of years by the accumulation of dense wet plant material. When drained or cleared by fire for commercial plantations, such as for palm oil or pulpwood, the carbon is released into the atmosphere. In 2013-2015, Indonesia experienced its most serious fires in some years, worsened by dry weather caused by an El Nino phenomenon, and cloaked large stretches of Southeast Asia in choking smog for mounts. The history proved that the peatlands fires only can be stopped completely by rainfall. On the other hand, the peatland fires usually occur in the dry season that rainfall is very rare. The technology of artificial precipitation has an important role to solve this kind of natural disaster. The aim of this research is to study the impact of the application of the WMT on increasing of precipitation for mitigation of peatlands fire in Riau Province. The analysis was focused in the Kepulauan Meranti and Siak Regency which are very severe peatland fire in 2014, 2015, and 2016. This research found that the application of weather modification technology could increase precipitation occurrence and significantly reduce peatland fire in Riau. The increasing rainfall value (PCH) in Kepulauan Meranti Regency were 1.019, 1.08, 0.68, and 1.649 during four times WMT application from 2014 to 2016. However, the PCH value in Siak Regency during four times WMT application in 2014 to 2016 were 1.127, 0.7, 0.66, and 1.88.",

Design of experiment was set two factors with three level in each factor and three replication, so the L9 Taguchi’s orthogonal array was applied. The minimum conditions were determined using S/N ratio with a quality character of smaller is better (SB). In addition, to determine the significance of the welding parameters used ANOVA. The results show that the welding current of 170 A and the welding speed of 4.0 mm/s were obtained as the minimum of longitudinal bending distortion and angular distortion. Based on analysis of variance, the welding current was a parameter that greatly affects the longitudinal bending distortion with the percentage contribution of 64.36% while angular distortion was strongly influenced by welding speed parameter with the percentage contribution of 53.38%.",

      "abstract": "Collages are generally known as mixed media techniques that can be used as representational media to express an idea that represents a concept. In the context of architecture, to be able to communicate an idea or concept idea into a visual form, a media is needed as a medium to convey the idea of the designer, so that the client can understand the idea. In the process of designing, the role of collage as a visual representation medium can make collage one of the potential methods to represent an architect's idea by combining fragments of design elements to produce new work with new meaning. Collage can initiate and estimate the creation of architectural space by representing the meaning of an object into space (Socio, 2006; Martin, 2007). The meaning of a design has the potential to add value to the existence of a building because with the meaning of the design; buildings can develop into a cultural heritage building that is not lost to the times. By using the collage method in the design process, the meaning of a building can be arranged so that the building can maintain its existence. However, collage has not been widely used as a method that is considered the potential in the architectural design process. So in this paper, the author aims to see the potential of collage as a method used in the design process, which is then proven by studying the Villa Isola cultural heritage building. The results of observations show that in the design process of Villa Isola, there is a compilation of contextual elements that form the design meaning by the collage method so that the building can still retain its meaning.",

      "abstract": "The rapid growth of railway based public transportation in metropolitan city is followed by its supporting facilities such as underground tunnel. The minimum exposure towards ambient air in underground tunnel encourages the further studies about the smoke behavior which effects visibility change. In the existing situation, the smoke extraction system is supported by forced ventilation which has been qualitatively known to be able in extracting smoke during the evacuation time. The studies about the natural ventilation towards visibility change in conflagration at underground tunnel become interesting to be done due to the possibility of smoke extraction system failure while evacuation is being held. The laboratory fire test is held at a 1:16,25 scaled tunnel model and numerical simulation using Fire Dynamics Simulation version 6 with 1:16,25 scale. The Froude Number is kept to be constant for both of the methods to ensure the ratio between fluid inertia force and its weight are similar so the full scaled smoke behavior can be generally predicted by the laboratory scaled result. The different trend in visibility declination among the methods as the result indicates an inaccuracy of the simulation method to predict the visibility declination characteristic by the time. It is only generally able to predict whether the visibility decline or is constant by the time. The final conditional conclusion can be highlighted from this research is natural ventilation is proven to be able to reduce the visibility declination when the conflagration occurs.",

The factors that affect the quality of rainwater runoff in the rainwater harvesting system are the rainwater harvesting components and external factors, such as climatological conditions that include the intensity of rainfall and dry days. This study aims to analyze the quality of rainwater runoff from various types of roof, the influencing factors, and the potential utilization of rainwater runoff in residential–industrial areas. Three types of full-scale roofs—asbestos, clay tile, and galvanized zinc—were observed. Rainwater runoff was sampled from each type of roof using a composite method. The Mann–Whitney test and Spearman’s correlation coefficient were used to determine the significance of the factors that influenced the quality of the rainwater runoff and the relationships of each factor to the quality of rainwater runoff, respectively. The results revealed that internal factors, such as type of roofing material and slope of the roof, have a significant influence on the quality of rainwater runoff, while a high intensity of rainfall and long dry periods, as external factors, caused higher concentrations of contaminants in rainwater runoff. Though some parameters of rainwater runoff met quality standards, it is recommended that a simple water treatment unit be installed to ensure clean water for sanitation needs.",

      "abstract": "Bio-Jet, is an alternative fuel from avtur, could be produced by synthesis of vegetable oil through the hydrodeoxygenation, decarboxylation, decarbonation, and catalytic cracking process. Physical characteristics, activities, and selectivity of the catalyst used will determine the rate, conversion, and yield of the reaction that being carried out. This study aims to compare and obtain the best characteristics of NiMoP / γ-Al2O3 catalysts synthesized using two types of preparation, impregnation and microwave polyol methods, which will be used for bio-jet production. The impregnation method takes more than 24 hours for catalyst preparation, while microwave polyols that use microwaves are able to synthesize catalysts faster. Catalysts with equal loading of 20% in the impregnation method will have a pore radius of 3.2889 nm, total pore volume of 0.11132 cc / g, and surface area of 67.693 m2/g, while the microwave polyol method has a pore radius of 2.2544 nm, total pore volume of 0.045263 nm, and the surface area of 40.1545 m2/g. Both catalysts have almost the same loading on the weight of the catalyst, which in the microwave polyol method has a more dispersed promotor and active site, although the crystallinity level are very low and tend to be amorphous compared to the impregnation method with high crystallinity. In bio-jet synthesis reaction with operating conditions of 5% catalyst loading by comparison to coconut oil, 4000C, and 15 bar, the conversion, yield, and selectivity of catalyst impregnation were 91.705%, 47.639%, and 84.511%, while microwave polyol catalysts were 90.296%, 42.752%, and 82.517%, respectively",

The active materials of LiMn0.7Fe0.3PO4 was synthesized via hydrothermal method from the precursors of LiOH, NH4H2PO4, FeSO4.7H2O and MnSO4.7H2O. The activated carbon was pyrolyzed from coconut shell whereas the carbon nanotube (CNT) was commercially available in the market. The composite was prepared using ball-mill to mix the components homogeneously. Simultaneous thermal analysis STA was used to determine the phase formation of LiMn0.7Fe0.3PO4 to which the sintering process was conducted at 700 °C. The samples in powder forms after sintering were characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM) to examine the morphology, whereas X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to identify the phases formed. The performance of the composite for use in lithium ion battery cathode was characterized after assembling it in a coin battery and tested using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and charge-discharge process. SEM results showed that the samples containing CNTs above 2.5% or more have active material homogeneously coated by activated carbon and CNTs. At the same time, XRD results indicated that LiMn0.7Fe0.3PO4 phase has formed, but it still lacks of the crystallinity indicated by low intensity of the diffractogram peaks. EIS test results showed that the presence of activated carbon and CNTs in LiMn0.7Fe0.3PO4 to form LiMn0.7Fe0.3PO4/CNTs/C gives significant improvement in the conductivity. However, because of some impurities and lack of the crystallinity, the composite produces low capacity value during charge-discharge test, 4 mAh/gr.",

However, the amount of fruit waste from the supply chain that supports the production is still uncertain. This study aims to record the production of fruit waste from the fruit distribution process at three stages: farmers, wholesalers, and retailers then provide suggestions to overcome this problem. Data obtained through direct sampling on research sites, which conducted in 3 different locations for each stage and 10 random samples were taken in each locations. The results show that farmers stage does not produce waste. The wholesalers stage produces average waste 1.98% of total production. The retailers stage produces 2 types of waste: transport waste with average production 0.67% of total production, and daily waste with average production 2.53% of total production. Based on direct observation on research sites, improvement in handling systems at distribution process are needed to prevent waste production. The implementation of countermeasures also needed to reuse the waste by applying the circular economy method that can provide economic benefits for the implementers. These applications include: utilizing it for animal feed, and as fertilizing plantation land.",

Current increase of last mile delivery is the impact of increasing home delivery service in an area due to growing development of e-commerce. In its operation process there are several issues, including the high number of trips from parcel delivery service. One of the innovations used to solve these issues is smart locker system. The objective of this research is to analyze the characteristic and efficiency of smart locker system that has been running in Jabodetabek to reduce the trip of home delivery service. Data analysis were performed using travel diary data of one of Smart Locker operator. The obtained result is that the use of smart locker is still having issues, causing the performance of each transit hub (as a part of trip chain smart locker) to have a significant difference. One of the issues include the variable of waiting time either at the pickup or at the delivery of shipments. Another issue is that the coverage area for each locker is not the same, thus affecting the performance of each transit hub. In terms of delivery trip length, the use of smart locker is 30.65% more efficient when compared to parcel delivery service, where in order to deliver 222 items, the total trip length is 717.8 km if using the parcel delivery service, while using the smart locker requires total trip length of 497.83 km.",

Acetate additives on the inoculum are expected to optimize the formation of methanogenic microorganisms that can improve the performance of anaerobic fermentation. There are 2 types of inoculums used in this study, namely natural inoculum and modified inoculum. Natural inoculum is made from cow manure diluted with a ratio 1:1. Meanwhile, modified inoculum is made of shrimp paste, granulated sugar, rotten banana tree trunks, milk, bran, yeast extract, Lactobacillus MRS Broth, rumen fluid, and acetate addition. The parameters tested in this study include microbial diversity, biogas production, Volatile Solids Destruction (VSD), and Chemical Oxygen Demand removal (CODr). The results showed that acetate additives are not proven to enrich the population of methanogenic microorganisms and biogas production. However, modified inoculums with acetate additives are shown to increase methane concentration, VSD up to 91%, and CODr up to 99.5%. This shows that the modified inoculum has a great potential as a growth medium to treat food waste using Anaerobic Digestion (AD) with the help of pH control, which correspond with the optimum pH range for the methanogenesis stage.",

In flying vehicles, the determination of the center of gravity is done by arranging the components of the vehicle so that the center of gravity falls within that range. In this study, the compilation of components with two configurations was carried out, the fuel tank was in the middle (first configuration) and the fuel tank was in the back (second configuration). The results obtained that the center of gravity in the first configuration is located at 444.7 mm and the second configuration is located at 366.05 mm in front of the forwards center of gravity limits. The second configuration will tend to be more stable. However, both configurations will cause the aircraft to get nose heavy. This study also calculates the canard angle. When the aircraft cruising, the canard angle is at 2.4 degrees. Whereas at the moment just before stalling, C_L requirement of the canard is -1,724, but the canard airfoil is only able to give -1,5977. Thus, the canard is unable to balance the aircraft's lift force in a stall condition.",

      "abstract": "High population growth has an impact on various aspects of life, especially traffic congestion. Traffic congestion causing unproductivity, waste of energy, increased levels of stress and health problem. According to BAPPENAS records, in 2017 Jabodetabek suffered losses of up to Rp 100 trillion, while in Jakarta Rp. 67.5 trillion. Many solutions to overcome traffic congestion have been offered from widening roads, improving public transportation system and information system based traffic regulation. However, traffic congestion is still an unsolved problem. Imagine there is a car that can operate on sky as well with the size of a car. But the next problem is how to maximize the limited space of vehicle as fuel storage so that it can travel a long distance. Without increasing size and weight to the vehicle, efficiency can be achieved by reducing drag. Designing a wheel retraction system can reduce parasite drag up to 24%. The result of this design is a hydraulic pump with minimum pressure of 11.191 bar and flow rate of 0.136 lpm",

Over the year the number of car is keep increasing, according to the population of car, there is no more room on the road to line up the car while driving and simply create a traffic jam. By the time goes, the car itself is keep improving with new technology and features that makes the user more comfortable while riding it, but it does not solve the traffic jam problem unless the car is flying. Involving the aerospace engineering into the automotive industry is one big gap and has many limitations, but it does not rule out the possibility to make a flying car. Wing is needed on this project to handle the air while the objects is flying. Few types of hinge and linkage is well design to achieve a folding mechanism design that fit into the structure of the wing. The folded wing mechanism can be used when it fully expands for flying and folded for driving on regular street.",

In this paper, a battery management system which can protect and do passive balancing of the battery from overcharging are carried out. The overcharging protection circuit is tested by monitoring the voltage and current values of each battery cell when it is charged, simultaneously. While the passive balancing circuit is conducted only by measuring the voltage value of each battery cell. Based on the measurements, the proposed circuit is able to protect from overcharging and to balance each battery cell at a voltage of 3.75 Volt with a charging current of 0.2 Ampere.",

Not only the air condition, the high demand for processed petroleum such as gasoline and diesel causes Indonesia to import where in 2018 there are 393,000 barrels per day. Of course, the budget spent to meet the fuel needs is not small, and will not decrease for the next few years, given that Indonesia's petroleum stock has also decreased. Based on these problems, Universitas Indonesia is committed to build an environmentally friendly transportation, called Electric Bus. This Electric Bus has prime mover in the form of a 3 phase induction motor. Author on this paper is doing the research to build an electric motor design used on The Bus, so that the motor can produce performance in accordance to the design specifications that is 100 kW, where three motors will be combined to produce 300 kW of power with 1200 Nm of torque. This research focuses on motor construction, as well as the selection of materials where the material used is from Indonesia so that all components of the motor are originally made in Indonesia, with the best quality and specifications. This design has been successfully made resulting a weight of 298 kg and dimensions of 630 mm x 470 mm. The results of this research are expected to be able to electrify The Yellow Buses at Universitas Indonesia.",

Investigating the causes of brake failure suggests that failure in the braking system is caused by excessive heat due to friction between brake elements to withstand the load and speed of the vehicle. Malfunction of braking system, for example a less gripping caliper will be seen from the heat produced by the brake lining. If one of the brake units does not work, the braking load from other units will increase and can cause excessive heat. This incident is common in tank trucks that cause explosions. This project is aimed to investigate the cause of braking system failure in tank truck using brake temperature sensor. The sensor could analyze the brake performance by determining the safe temperature of the drum brake itself. The sensors would be placed in all drum brakes to detect the temperature in each wheel. If one brake is not functioned on the safe temperature, the sensor would alert the driver. By applying this method, the risk of accident would be reduced",

Succinic acid is considered as one of the high-value added products with broad range of application in industries including food, textile, leather, chemical and pharmaceutical. Semi Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSSF) is one of the fermentation configuration for succinic acid production that is more preferable due to SSSF produces higher concentration and yield of bio-succinic acid compared by another configuration. Oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) can be used as a raw material for bio-succinic acid production due to its cellulose content, low prices, and availability. The bacteria used for fermentation are obtained from cow rumen. Moreover, immobilization of bacteria is an efficient way to improve cell stability. Therefore, the aim of this study was to produce bio-succinic acid from OPEFB using immobilized bacteria which were isolated from Indonesian cow rumen and to investigate the effect of variation of hydrolysis time to the bio-succinic acid production. Bacterial isolation from cow rumen was carried out through several stages such as enrichment, subculture and isolation using screening agar plates. The bacterial colonies produced from the screening process were then incubated and immobilized using agar as a carrier. OPEFB preparation steps involved pretreatment to eliminate the lignin content contained in the OPEFB by reduced the size followed by in-sequence utilization of peracetic acid (PA) and alkaline peroxide (AP) solutions by chemical method. The OPEFB was then enzymatically hydrolyzed using cellulase enzymes for 2 – 6 hours prior to fermentation. Based on results, bio-succinic acid produced from this process has a concentration of 0.559 g/L. This result was obtained from hydrolysis at 6 hours with initial glucose concentration was 0.119 g/L. Yield of bio-succinic acid obtained from glucose in this process was found to be 4.712 g/g glucose while yield of bio-succinic acid obtained from OPEFB in this process was found to be 0.028 g/g OPEFB.",

In 2018, there was an increase of up to 10% from the previous year. This gas is harmful to human and the environment. One way to reduce pollution from vehicle emissions is by adsorption. Adsorption is often used because its large absorption capacity reaches 95%. Of the several types of adsorbents, the most developed ones are activated carbon because of its low price and high adsorption ability. The use of commercial activated carbon has begun to be replaced with activated carbon made from biomass waste because it is cheaper and environmentally friendly. CO and HC gas molecules can be absorbed properly in activated carbon. To improve the adsorption ability of activated carbon, it is modified with MgO with impregnation method. With modifications using activated carbon and MgO ratio of 70:30, 80:20, and 90:10, the surface area results are 1149.48 m2/g, 890.23 m2/g, and 859.91 m2/g. CO and HC Adsorption were carried out with inside tube variant of 3 cm, 4 cm, and 5 cm. this inside tube is used to put the adsorbent. The results showed with increasing the length of the inside tube, the CO adsorption yield increased from 78.68 to 99.14% and HC to 64.54 87.73%. So the modification of AC with MgO had a significant effect for pollutant gases adsorption",

      "abstract": "In this study, the effect of variation of intermittent wire feeding method on thermal histories during welding process, the physical appearance, mechanical properties and fracture mode were investigated. The configuration parameter of wire feeding was determined by the properties of the so called length ratio (RL). It was influenced by welding speed, wire feeding speed, feeding time and delaying time. The thermal histories investigation shows the peak temperature 275 ± 17 °C on average at 8 cm from the start location with 2 mm/s welding speed and 10 second pre-heating time. Bigger value of length ratio has tendency to have smaller bead width with higher cap. Also larger ratio has tendency to have bigger tensile strength and the fracture location close to the weld bead.",

This study develops a multi criteria model to evaluate the sustainable transportation system. A literature study is carried out to identify the indicators and then validated by the experts. As a result, a total of sixteen indicators divided into six indicators of economic aspect, five indicators of social aspect, and five indicators of environmental aspect are proposed as the indicators of sustainable transportation evaluation. Next, the relationships among the indicators are determined using the Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) method. The results show that six indicators consist of accessibility of region, management of public transportation, infrastructure of public transportation, transportation for people with special needs, level of traffic congestion, and land use to improve transportation facilities identified as the most influencing indicators. On the other hand, passenger convenience is suggested as the most dependent indicator. The importance weight of indicators is then determined using the Analytic Network Process (ANP) method. The land use to improve transportation facilities is regarded as the most important indicator, followed by level of traffic congestion, and transportation for people with special needs. The model is expected to help the policy maker in improving the performance of sustainable transportation system.",

      "abstract": "Anaerobic Digestion is an alternative technology used for treating food waste. But the AD process can be influenced by several elements that can be toxic. One of them is sodium, the sodium content in food waste with a concentration of > 3.100 mg/L has the potential to cause inhibition which results in an imbalance of the AD process with indicators of VFA formation and PCOD removal. Sodium inhibition can be controlled with magnesium because magnesium metal ions have the opposite effect on sodium inhibition by reducing VFA concentration and increasing the percentage of COD removal. This study aims to analyze the effect of magnesium addition on VFA and PCOD at the hydrolysis stage. This research was conducted with a 848 L capacity single stage reactor for 128 days. In the operational phase carried out for 51 days, the reactor is filled with substrate 5 days a week with Organic Loading Rate (OLR) of 10 kg VS / m3 with 2 filling phases, control phase and test phase. In the control phase, the reactor is only filled with substrate, while in the test phase, in addition to the substrate, magnesium (MgSO4) is added as much as 170 gr/day. In steady state conditions, the control phase shows the average COD removal 94.2 ± 3.34%, SCOD 98 ± 1%, PCOD 94 ± 3.6%, and formation of VFA 1,800 ± 200 mg/L and hydrolysis rate 6.92 ± 0.32 mg.PCOD/L/d. The addition of MgSO4 in the test phase showed a significant difference (P <0.05) in the formation of VFA to 1,066 ± 57.7 mg/L. While the average allowance for COD, SCOD, and PCOD did not show a significant difference (P> 0.05) with a value of 84.7 ± 6.8% respectively; 96 ± 1%; 83.3 ± 7.3%. The hydrolysis rate in the test phase also did not show a significant difference to 6.24 ± 0.57 mg.PCOD/L/d. This study also reviewed the relationship between VFA and PCOD parameters with the hydrolysis rate. Correlation test results showed a strong level of correlation (P = 0.67) between VFA parameters on the rate of hydrolysis, while the PCOD parameter test results showed a moderate correlation level (P = 0.41) to the rate of hydrolysis. Therefore, when the hydrolysis rate is high, the level of VFA formation and PCOD removal increases.",

      "abstract": "Plastics materials have been an integral part in people’s daily life due to their high elasticity, formability and lightweight which are suitable for many products. However, exponentially growth of plastics waste leads to heavy environmental problems due to the plastics nature which is not easily degradable. One of solution to alleviate environmental problems due to plastics waste is to use pyrolysis method to burn plastics waste and convert them into lighter hydrocarbon which can be used as a source of energy. In this final project, the addition of zeolite catalyst in pyrolysis process of Polypropilene plastic waste has been studied in the terms of energy activation. Isoconversional Friedman and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa methods were used. It wa found that the addition of zeolite of 10 % w/w can reduce the activation energy around 40 kJ/mol.",

Men are identified with income-earning activities (traveling and working) while women are associated with domestic work. However, there has been a transition in the economic world where today women have the right to work in the office. Even so, men and women have different needs and physical characteristics. One of the periodic psychological processes experienced by women is the menstrual events that have a certain impact on mood changes and behaviour that will affect their spatial needs and performance of female employees (A.M. Sugeng Budiono, 2003). This paper is a preliminary study to overview the effectiveness of spatial organizations in accommodating menstruating women while working. Case studies were carried out in an office room in skyscrapers (Tempo Scan Tower) with interview methods and observations of interior elements. The research focused on observing the impact of atmosphere and colors towards women’s menstrual cycle that leads to depression- related to how women occupy spaces. The expected results are a comprehensive assessment of the current state of office space in accommodating specific needs.",

Motivated by this, therefore, the current study is focusing on the optimization of material properties used as bone scaffold. A biomaterial of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/chitosan-hydroxyapatite (HA) composite was successfully made by wet chemistry method, followed by freeze thawing and freeze drying. For comparison purposes, the percentage of HA has been varied from 0, 25 and 40 % (wt/v). The resulting composites were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), compressive test, and swelling behavior. The results showed that the addition of HA up to 40% (wt/v) has yielded a porous structure with an average pore size of 42.39 µm. In addition, the compressive modulus was enhanced from 14 MPa for 0% HA to 143, and 191 MPa for composites with the addition of HA from 25 to 40% (wt/v). The addition of HA has also reduced the swelling ratio from 296% for the sample without HA to 85 and 78 % for sample with addition of HA from 25 to 40 (wt/v), respectively. The obtained results show that PVA/chitosan-HA in this study is potential to be used as scaffold in bone tissue engineering.",

To determine the abundance of each component inside a pixel, we used a process called hyperspectral unmixing. In hyperspectral unmixing, each pixel in an image is compared to a spectral library to determine material types and their proportion in the pixel. In this study, we construct an algorithm to optimize the hyperspectral unmixing problem using L2,1 norm and Total Variation regularization to reduce error. Specifically, our research aims to improve the unmixing results by applying L2,1 norm to impose collaborative sparsity on all pixels in the data set and adding Total Variation regularization to improve the smoothness of resulting image.

In general, cast iron has a main alloy consisting of carbon and silicon where both elements have an influence on the potential of graphitization and castability. In this work, the influence of strontium (Sr) added to molten cast iron with a composition of 0, 0.04, 0.06 and 0.08 wt% to graphite morphology were studied. The sample obtained will be carried out a characterization process by observing macro and microstructures using optical microscope equipped with image data processing software that displays graphite fraction, size, form and nodularity. Analysis showed that Sr addition increase in nodularization of graphite from 19.6 % to 31.5% at 0.08 wt% Sr addition",

      "abstract": "Accuracy of demand forecasting greatly influences the performance of the supply chain system which ultimately has a direct impact on the business perfomance. Accurate forecasting will be able to utilize company resources efficiently. However, in practice many companies admit that their forecasting process is not going as well as they expected. Most companies only use historical data to forecast future demand. Whereas past demand data is not enough to be used as the basis for future forecasts. Therefore it is necessary to build a model that is able to accommodate this phenomenon. This study proposed a multiple linear regression forecasting model for fast moving product. The independent variables used are climate, promotion, cannibalization, holidays, product prices, number of stores, population and income that always change over time. The results show that the proposed multiple linear forecasting model is more than three time more accurate than company forecast.",

      "abstract": "Utility infrastructure assets in the United States continue to grow as millions of utility features were installed within the properties of state and local agencies. With this growth, the management of the utility data records is becoming a complex problem in terms of large amounts of data. On one hand, management of data for utility infrastructures is extremely valuable to state and local agencies because the timely access to utility-related information is a significant requirement for the delivery of construction and renovation projects on time and within budget. On the other hand, many challenges arise, such as difficulties in effective data storage of complex and messy datasets, data analysis, and data visualization. Utility owners face challenges in collecting utility data in standardized formats, data storage, and providing easy access to all stakeholders. Using a case study in Nevada, this paper demonstrates how tools and a strategic workflow process can be harnessed to develop an end-to-end management solution for large and complex data of a utility infrastructure. This end-to-end utility data management solution builds upon existing systems which are not adequate for large utility data management because they are non-scalable, do not allow for access by multiple users, involve manual data uploads, do not control consistency of data attributes, and lack visualization tools for non-GIS experts. In addition, they do not provide an end-to-end data management pipeline from data acquisition, through data integration, quality control, storage and finally to data access. The developed system in this case study was used for an end-to-end management test of large data during the testing phase and proved to perform seamlessly. Our approach could be adopted by other utility jurisdictions to manage their utility data. Such a data management system allows for automated and proper management of utility data thereby helping state and local agencies reduce utility conflicts and offset construction costs due to utility damages. This data could be combined with other rich data sources, such as financial data, and mined for valuable, hidden insights.",

Characterization of the sample’s structure was performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), which expose the presence of TiO2 rutile and Sn in each sample. The surface area of samples observed using Brunner-Emmet-Teller (BET), which indicates the different surface area of each Sn addition. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) suggested agglomeration and poor distribution appear in every sample. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed to measure battery’s performance, two peaks occur as a sign of reversible reaction. Impedance of Li4Ti5O12/Sn measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), the test performed before and after Cyclic voltammetry (CV), each test showed the different result for each sample. Other than EIS and CV, Charge-Discharge (CD) also performed, examinations in different C-rate were performed, and higher Sn concentration leads to lower stability in high C. The result reveals that addition of 20% Sn optimizes Li4Ti5O12 in enhancing capacity and conductivity.",

For these reasons, this paper discusses how the image of the region by the impact of the temporary installation as the main trigger on the existence of the street vendor. This paper focuses on the impact of the installation to the tourist’s interpretation while they are walking along the corridor of the Malioboro Street, then we analyze our observation data based on the “multisensory perception” theory of the Juhani Pallasmaa (1996) to criticize how the overall impact contributes to Malioboro's image.

Hence, Deaf people need a certain spatial configurations that not only support their communication needs, but also creating comfortable distance between people, especially in a public social place such as café. Objective of this paper is to to investigate whether the concept of spatial proximity might provide physical and social comfort for deaf people. For this purpose, the author observed a café specialized for Deaf community, Kopi Tuli. Findings from this study show that spatial configurations support their visual needs so Deaf people can interact effectively with sign language and adjusting their comfort distance with various people.",

There are more than 1000 species of cellulose plants available in fiber form and a number of them are being investigated as composite reinforcement materials. Sugarcane bagasse and rice husk as reinforcement materials and polylactic acid (PLA) as a matrix were employed to make biocomposites. At this research work, sugarcane bagasse was given two different kinds of treatment; some were alkali treated using 8 wt.% NaOH at room temperature for an hour and some others were steam treated at 0.75 MPa for 30 minutes. The fiber content of the composites changed with weight percentage ratios of sugarcane bagasse/rice husk/PLA was 25/0/75, 25/5/70 and 25/10/65. Flexural properties were tested in accordance with ASTM D790-17 and structural evaluation was evaluated using scanning electron microscope (SEM) on the fracture section of the flexural test samples. Composites produced using steam treated sugarcane bagasse and rice husk have lower area density (1277-1385 g/m2) compared to the ones formed using NaOH treated bagasse and rice husk (1162-1500 g/m2). Both values of area density are below the density of neat PP and wood flour reinforced PP composites used as reference materials. The flexural test shows the NaOH treatment on the bagasse fibers improve the flexural strength of the composites but the rice husk content introduced to the structure reduce the strength of the composites. SEM evaluation shows fiber fracture and few pull-out.",

A big issue comes when deciding a new power plant whether to use natural gas or coal as its source of energy. In area such as South East Asia, natural gas price is higher than coal, hindering such uses. In order to make natural gas power plant more viable, optimization must be taken. This study will optimize the location of 5 power plants and pipeline route among 11 locations and 2 natural gas sources, so the weighted length is minimum. A mathematical model of a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Problem (MINLP) model has been developed to solve the problem. The model is solved with a-two step optimization. The first step is used to obtain optimal location and pipeline route, while the second step is used to obtain optimal pipeline diameter and compressor configuration. A weighted element was added to the pipeline length to accommodate the difference of pipeline diameter. Six are were made in this study to give a different location and routing possibility regarding possible future scenarios.",

A Post-Weld Heat Treatment (PWHT) process was implemented to a vessel undergone weld repair due to leakage. Due to the thick wall of the welded bottom head, this welding process must be followed by the PWHT to relieve the residual stress, as well as to improve the material properties. PWHT process was performed by heating the welded area to reach 675 °C temperature. A numerical approach using finite element analysis (FEA) method was performed to analyze the integrity of the vessel. Based on the analysis, the structure is still stable within the applied load. PWHT process does not lead to buckling on the main structure and the load is still lower than the load required for the occurrence of buckling. A sensitivity analysis was also performed with reduced temperatures to 630 °C or reduction of PWHT area width. These changes were found to have negligible effects in reducing the stress and strains in the vessel. After PWHT is completed, the structure is still considered to be safe to be operated, as indicated by its strain that is still below the allowable strain and only relatively small deflection was occurred.",

      "abstract": "Dissimilar metal welding was mostly done to optimize the application and engineering requirements with economic considerations. Weld microstructures greatly influenced the mechanical properties of welded joints. The investigations were carried out to evaluate the microstructural and mechanical properties of dissimilar weldment between carbon steel ASTM A36 and austenitic stainless steel 304 with a variation of welding position (1G, 2G, 3G) and weld thickness (6 mm to 12 mm) joints by TIG welding. A detailed analysis was conducted on the weld zone composition, the microstructural, and mechanical properties. The results show that the welding position and thickness of the weld joints influenced the microstructure both in HAZ and weld metal. Size, distribution, and orientation of microstructure were improved and more uniform with increasing of welded joint thickness. In HAZ carbon steel, GB ferrite was dominant, especially for the flat welding position (1G) while for the horizontal position (2G) and the vertical welding position (3G) showed other structures such as Widmanstaten ferrite, hard-structures like martensite and bainite. In the region near the fusion line and the weld metal, the chemical composition changed due to thermal convection, diffusion, and macro-segregation caused by penetration of liquid metal carbon steel into the weld pool. SEM/EDAX results indicated diffusion of carbon from carbon steel A36 to stainless steel 304 and formed the hard-structure along the fusion line. The mechanical test results showed that the tensile test breaking point occurred in the parent metal of carbon steel A36. The bending test results showed very high stress on the face side of the welding joint, and there are no cracks from bending test result. Vickers hardness testing showed that the hardness distribution increased from the carbon steel HAZ to the stainless steel HAZ and the maximum hardness has achieved the value of 297 Hv at the fusion line of stainless steel 304.",

      "abstract": "Spirulina platensis is a blue-green microalgae (cyanobacteria) that is rich in potential in the fields of health, cosmetics and food. During this time, blue-green algae are widely used as food supplements, but the use in the cosmetics field is still lacking. One of the compounds produced by S. platensis is Flavonoid. Flavonoid (represented by quercetin) are one of the secondary metabolites produced by S. platensis that generaly supplied with food for the human body for it’s antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiallergic properties. However, when used on skin, flavonoid can absorb ultraviolet light. In this research, flavonoid extraction from S. platensis was carried out with in several methods, soxhletation and maceration. These two methods are chosen based on better guarantee of the acquisition of flavonoids, beside the methods that are quite simple. The solvent used to extract flavonoid are ethanol. The quantitative analysis was carried out with a spectrophotometer to measure the flavonoid content and the Sun Protection Factor (SPF) level. The highest yield extract of flavonoid were obtained from the soxhletation method with a yield value of 5.26%. The value of Total Flavonoid Content obtained from both methods has similar results, that is 124.37 mg quercetin / g extract for soxhletation method and 127.10 mg quercetin / g extract for maceration method. The highest SPF value was generated from the soxhletation method with the value 6.47.",

      "abstract": "Having an abundant resource of laterite ore, Indonesia has the advantage of developing lateritic steel in many applications. Despite the interesting properties of lateritic steel such as high mechanical properties, low corrosion rate, and good machinability, application of lateritic steel for biomaterial application was lack of proper research. This study aims to observe the possibility of using lateritic steel which has low nickel content to be used as an orthopedic implant. Chemical composition was analyzed by optical emission spectroscopy method (OES). Microstructure analysis was analyzed by means of metallography using optical microscope and phase identification via X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Mechanical properties of laterite steel were examined by tensile testing and microhardness Vickers testing. Biomechanical simulation and stress distribution were evaluated using finite element analysis. Corrosion behavior of lateritic steel was observed by electrochemical testing in a simulated body fluid of Hank’s solution in 37 °C. This research showed the laterite steel has comparable mechanical properties with SS 316L with less of nickel content. Increasing the corrosion properties of the laterite steel would increase the possibility of applying laterite steel into biomaterial. Therefore, laterite steel, the local steel produced by Indonesia’s resources could be examined more comprehensively to be used as biomaterial mainly for orthopedic application.",

      "abstract": "In the field of agricultural machinery, the working resistance of many soil-touching component mainly comes from the sudden increase of working resistance or repeated impact load by the soil. The mathematical models of five biomimetic surface units, namely, convex hull, small convex hull, concave pit, small concave pit and conical pit, were established according to the geometric non-smooth structure of the Copris ochus typical microscopic structure. EDEM software was used to simulate the impact test of soil with 1m/s velocity and geometric non-smooth model plate. The simulation results show that the stress change of the bionic surface structure with convex hull is the largest in the unit time, which can reach 163.63% of the maximum variation range of the flat plate. The instantaneous impact stress of the bionic surface structure with pit shape is the largest. It can reach 159.32% of the maximum impact stress of the flat plate. The stress of the conical pit after one-time impact shows a high-variation amplitude in short time, which can reach 137.57% of the change amplitude of the flat plate. The variation range of the stress of the small-pit bionic surface structure in the unit time is the smallest, and the maximum change amplitude can reach 83% of the change amplitude of the flat plate. The bionic surface structure of the small convex hull shows the minimum impact stress, and the maximum instantaneous impact stress can reach 86.89% of the maximum impact stress of the flat plate. The impact performance of the bionic non-smooth surface is simulated in this passage , and the mechanical model of the impact property of the bionic non-smooth surface is established, and a certain basic research is provided for the optimization design of the agricultural soil-contacting component, and has a certain reference value.",

      "abstract": "Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI) is a cognitive disorder associated with cerebrovascular disorders. The cognitive regions included memory, attention, spatial visual ability and language. VCI became a major challenge in the health sector worldwide. VCI problems commonly occurred in developed countries and started to emerge in developing countries. In 2013, there were 1 million VCI sufferers in Indonesia and it is expected to double by 2030. Common cause of VCI are blood vessel disorders such as stroke, diabetes, brain injury and high blood pressure. Neurofeedback (NF) therapy can improve the quality of EEG of VCI patients. This study used quantitative (qEEG) parameters to differentiate between normal and VCI subject as well as to quantify the EEG signal improvements before and after NF therapy by sound waves. The quantitative parameters used in this study included power parameters, wave duration, and percentage of each frequency band of EEG signals. EEG signals were collected from 25 normal subjects and 12 subjects diagnosed with VCI. Results showed the difference in absolute power and relative power between normal and VCI subjects. Normal subjects dominant frequency were in alpha band with average percentage of 50.4% while for VCI subjects dominant frequency were in delta band with an average percentage of 69%. After each NF therapy session of VCI subjects by sound wave, there were an increase of alpha band frequency by an average of 1.6%. In addition, decay occurs in delta band frequency by an average of 2.7%. There was no significant change in the wave duration during therapy. In conclusion, qEEG parameters can be used to differentiate between normal and VCI subjects especially the EEG power parameters.",

      "abstract": "The development of chitosan-alginate matrices loaded with Anredera cordifolia Steenis (Madeira-vine) leaf extract as an extended release formulation is herewith described. Madeira-vine plants have been known used traditionally to treat various ailments such as anti-inflammation, hypertension, and skin diseases. The matrices were prepared using the ionotropic gelation method with tripolyphosphate as the cross-linking agent. Scanning electron microscope and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were used to investigate the surface morphology and the structure of the matrices, respectively. The effect of alginate addition was studied by determining the physical characteristics of the matrices, encapsulation efficiency, loading capacity, matrix yield, as well as the release profiles of the bioactive compounds in simulated gastrointestinal fluids. The bioactive compounds in the leaf extracts and matrices, quantified as total phenolics, was determined using UV-spectrophotometry. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to determine the amount of vitexin present in the leaf extracts. The encapsulation efficiency of the phenolic compounds was at least 90%, the highest loading capacity was 1.23%, and matrix yield was at least 83%. The in vitro release assays showed a reduced cumulative release of phenolic compounds in synthetic gastric fluid (35 to 12%), and, in three synthetic gastrointestinal fluids (71 to 50%) after 24 hours, due to the addition of alginate in the chitosan matrix. These results indicate the possibility of employing chitosan-alginate matrix to shift the release of phenolics of Anredera cordifolia extracts from the gastric area to the colon area.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. The symptoms include cognitive impairment and gait disturbances. Gait analysis reports showed that people with AD have slower gait speed, shorter step lengths, and lower step frequency. It was suggested that gait analyses may be important for therapies and diagnosis. However, recent gait analysis reports still involved floor sensors and wearable sensors, which may not be convenient for elderly patients. In this report, we proposed the use of Kinect™ device: a machine vision gait analysis approach. This device has been used for rehabilitation purposes in elderly care and stroke rehabilitation. Furthermore, it has been used in neurodegenerative disease studies. In this report, we would like to extract gait components of a person based on the Kinect™ 25-joint system. It started with two subjects walking down a measurement aisle 5 times. The recorded videos of the 2 subjects were subsequently interpreted into the position of joints over time following the Cartesian coordinate. Next, we extracted the gait components manually from the joints involved in determining gait components (left foot & right foot) using a Microsoft Excel software. The result validation was done using t-tests comparing the gait components of the 2 subjects. It was shown that the results were valid, which opens an opportunity to use this device for AD therapies.",

The other main methods of identification are fingerprints and DNA analysis. The method of forensic dentistry analysis and DNA analysis is a very accurate combination of techniques. Often the sampling of the victim is done in the area of the mouth, teeth and buffer tissue then DNA testing is carried out. One result of DNA testing is DNA damage (DNA adduct) due to the process of alkylating agent genotoxicity. The DNA adducts that can be observed are N7-methylguanine, O6-methylguanine and O4-methylthymine. Alkyl compounds are nitrosamine compounds that contain nitrate or nitrite. These alkyl compounds are commonly used as chemotherapeutic agents against cancer. Based on this literature review, the authors want to analyze DNA adducts formed by exposure to alkyl compounds so that they can be used as evidence of forensic identification.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Dengue Fever (DF) is an infectious disease caused by dengue virus (DENV) infection which is transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquito bite. There are approximately 50 million DENV cases annually in the world with 500 thousand cases hospitalized. Incidence rate of DENV infection is increasing in Indonesia every year. Specific antiviral that can inhibit or mitigate the progression of the disease have been investigated for many decades. However, until now, management of DENV patients is only supportive. Specific antiviral drug to DENV is not available yet. The objective of this study is to determine antiviral activity of Ceiba pentandra and Eugenia uniflora leaf extract against DENV replication in Huh7it-1 cell line. Study design was an experimental study with a Focus assay and MTT assay to determine the effectivity and toxicity, respectively. Ceiba pentandra leaf extract showed IC50, CC50 and SI of 15.49 µg/ml, 81.1 µg/ml and 5.23. In other hand, E. uniflora revealed IC50, CC50, and SI of 19.83 µg/ml, 134.42 µg/ml and 6.78. We concluded that C. pentandra and E. uniflora leaf extract have potential as antiviral drug to DENV. Further studies are needed to explore the substance of C. pentandra and E. uniflora leaf extract that have antiviral activities to DENV.",

      "abstract": "It has been predicted that by 2019, 91.1% of capsule shells produced are made from gelatin which is not suitable for vegetarian and some religious groups. Research on vegetable capsule shells began to develop to substitute gelatin using seaweed extracts such as carrageenan, alginate, HPMC, and polyhydroxybutyrate. Spirulina platensis microalgae is a PHB producer that is easy to cultivate, its production can be optimized by modifying the extraction method. Solvent extraction is the most simple and economical extraction method with general stages in the form of cell disruption, PHB precipitation, and PHB purification. Sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) is a cell-disrupting solvent that is widely used for extraction of PHB from microalgae. The parameters tested in this study consists of: concentration of S. platensis sample cells shown as optical density (OD) ranging from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The PHB quantification and characterization method used was FTIR and it showed the similarity between extracted PHB from Spirulina platensis with commercial PHB. The expected results of this PHB extraction is to get maximum yield of PHB and the most efficient extraction method based on the independent variables. Extraction of microalgae sample with OD 4 using 4% NaClO is expected to have the highest yield of PHB.",

      "abstract": "In the medical world the role of imaging is very necessary because it can provide a picture of the shape of organs that can show the severity of an illness in the human body. It is so important that the patient must be imaging before the next medical action is taken. Currently imaging that is mostly done in the medical world is using high energy which can damage the body such as SPECT, PET, MRI and x-rays. Thus it is necessary to develop another imaging method in order to avoid damage to organs by high energy. One alternative method used is near infrared optical imaging because it is non-invasive, non-radiation, non-ionizing and low-cost. In optical imaging based on near infrared the role of wavelength is very dominant. Wavelength has an important role because one of the qualities and imaging specifications is determined by the characteristics of the wavelength. Electromagnetic waves that enter the human body will experience wavelength characterization according to the absorption capacity of its constituent tissue. The range of infrared spectral wavelengths enables selectivity so that it can distinguish and provide clear imaging of tissue tissues such as bones, muscle tissue, meat and tumors or cancer. In this study the authors carried out the development of near infrared-based optical imaging in the spectrum region of 750-940 nm to analyze the selectivity of absorption and transparency of light wavelengths in body organ tissues. In this study the object is limited to the palm of the hand and finger joints of the human hand. Determination of the level of contrast and saturation image is done using Lightroom Classic CC 8.2 software. This software can make arrangements in such a way that a good level of selectivity can be obtained so that the image of the body's tissue will be sharper.",

      "abstract": "Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is progenitor cell that capable to differentiate to various mesenchymal or non-mesenchymal lineages. MSC also play a role towards injury during healing and regeneration processes in most tissue. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) had been reported to induce endometrium regeneration, therefore a compacted form of PRP, known as platelet rich fibrin matrix (PRFM) was studied for its capability to host MSC and the behavior of MSC in the matrix. Methods: PRP gelation was generated by adding 25 mM of CaCl2 to form a coin shape with diameter of 5 cm. Each matrix was cut into half, seeded directly with bone marrow (hBM-MSC) and umbilical cord MSC (hUC-MSC) with seeding density of 2,000 cell.cm-2. Initial cellular attachment was analysed using H&E staining, while the cellular viability was assessed quantitatively using MTT assay and qualitatively using Live/Dead staining. Results: hUC-MSC showed the highest viability compared to hBM-MSC when delivered in PRFM, especially during the first and five days incubation, while after 10 dan 15 day incubation, the viability had dropped, as the Live/Dead staining indicated too crowded population and most cells were dead, perhaps due to asphyxia. hUC-MSC and hBM-MSC were seen to proliferated and infiltrated the PRFM over the time, although the ratio of dead cells was more dominant in the later day of incubation. Besides, direct seeding method was not ideal to deliver the cells when the construct was subjected to different treatment during the first 24 h as they were easily detached from the construct. Conclusion: PRFM can be used to deliver MSC to the site injury, however the direct seeding method was not optimal to hold the cells on place during the first 24 h incubation.first, second, and thirdlevel headings (first level heading)",

Effective analgesia has been reported to improve perioperative analgesia and inflammatory response. This study evaluated the efficacy of pre-incisional ultrasound-guided QL block to provide perioperative analgesia in patients undergoing transperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy. This prospective randomised control study involved 44 adult patients undergoing laparoscopic donor nephrectomy under general anaesthesia. Patients were randomly assigned to QL block group receiving 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.25% on each side or the control group. The intraoperative fentanyl consumption, postoperative Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at rest and movement, additional tramadol need at the first 24 hours were recorded. Blood samples for IL-6 measurement and haemodynamic profiles were collected after the anaesthesia induction, 2 hours of surgery, and 2 hours postoperatively. The intraoperative fentanyl consumption was significantly less in the QL block group (P<0.05). Heart rate, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure were significantly higher in the QL block group (P<0.05). The inflammatory response IL-6 level increased significantly higher in the control group (P<0.05). The postoperative NRS at rest and movement at 2 hours and 24 hours were significantly lower in the QL block group (P<0.001). The control group needed more additional intravenous tramadol postoperatively with a relative risk of 3.00 (1.43–6.29, P<0.05). The pre-incisional QL block with 0.25% bupivacaine reduces intraoperative opioid consumption, inflammatory response, postoperative pain at rest and during movement, and additional opioid needed, following transperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy.",

The medical equipments are developed to obtain the most effective and efficient for the quality and the cost. A research about infrared spectrum as the medical equipment be a highlight in the scientists since it can capture the blood vessel of human. Infrared penetrates the human skin and be captured by camera. Vein has a pattern and it can be used as human identification system. However, the images need enhancement because of low contrast. Wavelet transforms such as Haar and Daubechies can enhance the quality of vein images, hence the identification process can be proceed by using deep learning method. In this paper, we use one of convolutional neural networks (CNN) method called AlexNet structure as the deep learning method due to its high performance. As for the wavelet transforms, the Haar wavelet, Daubechies 2, Daubechies 4 and Daubechies 10 are selected for evaluation on palm vein images in the image preprocessing step. As a result, we found that the accuracy of the wavelet transforms and enhanced palm vein images are more than 92%. The highest accuracy can be achieved by applying Daubechies 10 wavelet transform with the accuracy of 93.50% 1.13.",

      "abstract": "The genetic variation in humans will later become one of the valuable sources of information in various fields, including in the process of forensic identification. However, not all forensic questions can be answered through genetic examination so that the scientific development in the field of DNA analysis continues to be improved, especially in the field of epigenetics. Knowledge of epigenetics and its relationship with dental anthropology is believed to be used as a basis for the development of DNA forensic science that can be useful for solving cases because epigenetic modification that occurs in each person during life is distinctive and different. The epigenetic approach in the forensic field in relation to dental anthropology has not been widely studied. Based on the background described above, this concise text was made with the aim of analyzing the relationship between epigenetics and dental anthropology for the development of the field of oral biology, including forensic dentistry.",

      "abstract": "Mucopolysaccharidosis II (MPS II), also known as Hunter syndrome, is a rare, recessive, X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of lysosomal enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S), encoded by IDS. I2S plays an important role in the lysosomal degradation of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate, with I2S deficiency leading to the accumulation of these glycosaminoglycans in the tissues. Exon-specific analyses of IDS exon 8 from eight Indonesian patients with MPS II from Cipto Mangunkusumo National Referral Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia, were performed using PCR and sequencing-based methods. A deletion mutation of exon 8 was identified amongst the patients. A single-nucleotide deletion variant (c.1023delA), causing a frameshift in the corresponding amino acid sequence (p.Glu341AspfsTer19), was observed in one patients. These mutations cause a reduction in the number of amino acids and changes in the structure of 3D proteins. There is no reduction and change in the active site of the protein, but the termination that occurs at the 359th codon causes a reduction of two glycosylation sites. This study provides the first mutation analysis of exon 8 of IDS, and successfully identified mutations within the IDS gene that may be associated with MPS II. These findings will be added to the IDS gene profile database and may help in the diagnosis of MPS II in the future.",

The corrosion resistance of specimens was evaluated in a Hank’s solution with addition of Zn element and TiH2 as foaming agent, through direct observations with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Electron Dispersion Spectrometry (EDS), static immersion tests, potentiodynamic evaluations and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). Time dependent characteristics of specimens and the corresponding Hank’s solution were analyzed at 2, 4, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours of immersion. Results indicate that the microstructure of the surface morphology of the alloy such as pores, pitting corrosion, needle shape and galvanic corrosion with the main corrosion product is Mg(OH)2 and Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2. The addition of Zn less than 6% wt will decreased the corrosion rate, but will increase if the addition 10% wt Zn. From this research, Mg-Zn-Ca alloy with addition of 6% wt Zn has the lowest corrosion rate with slowly changed of pH in the whole process.",

Job characteristics in the garment industry ae generally material-handling processes and processes involving machinery that have high repetition that can cause Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorder (WMSD). WMSD is one of the biggest occupational health problems nowadays. In this research, workers of screen printing division of garment industry Small Medium Enterprise (SME) which has the highest risk in one of the SME in Jakarta were evaluated for their working postures using posture evaluation index using virtual environment in Jack simulation. The result shows that the worker have low injury to middle-low injury and middle-low injury to middle-high injury risk from their working postures. The repetitiveness of the work due to the high demand of the products while there is only 5 workers available in the division and the awkward position of the workers while doing their work due to the height of the table might be the cause of the probability of WMSD. Increasing the number of worker and adjusting the height of the table may decrease the risk WMSD.",

The basic design of ESAR prosthetic foot consists of four main components: main plate, S-plate, base plate, and auxiliary body. SOLIDWORKS was used to modelling design of ESAR prosthetic foot. Furthermore, an ANSYS Workbench 16.2 was used to finite element analysis of ESAR prosthetics foot structure. Static simulation is carried out with a loading force of 750 N. This load represents the amount of force that received in the edge of the base-plate component during the push off phase. In the initial design, the maximum stress that occurs during the static loading is 353.96 MPa. It is exceeding the yield stress of aluminum 6061, 276 MPa, that means initial design has a failed due to static loading. There are four alternative structural reinforcement that offered to reduce maximum stress. The fourth version of reinforcement has a smallest maximum stress. Therefore, it was chosen as the design of ESAR prosthetic foot to be used in robotic prosthetics ankle. The equivalent stiffness of the ESAR prosthetic foot has been calculated to use in control system.",

Objective: To compare the efficacy on the use of CPP-ACP containing propolis and non propolis on the amount of Streptococcus mutans on mixed enamel surfaces of children aged 7 to 9 years old. Method: A quasi-experimental study using one group pretest-posttest design. The subjects were 32 children who were divided into two groups. Both of the groups carried out baseline on the variable number of S. mutans, which then to be applied with paste every day for 4 weeks, and final data collection was carried out afterwards. Results: There was a significant decrease in the number of S. mutans from each treatment group (p <0.05). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the decrease in the number of muteptic Streptococcus from the two groups compared. Conclusion: CPP-ACP containing propolis is not proven to be better than CPP-ACP non propolis in decreasing the number of Streptococcus mutans, yet it has the potential to be used as an alternative ingredient that could prevent demineralization and improve remineralization of enamel surfaces having white spots .",

      "abstract": "Accumulation of overtraining/OT volume, in the long run can lead to decreased performance called overtraining syndrome (OTS). Pathophysiology of OTS is associated with oxidative stress, a condition of imbalance between free radicals and endogenous antioxidants, which can lead to cardiovascular disorders. Some research shows that oxidative stress can be inhibited through antioxidants supplementation. Hibiscus Sabdariffa Linn. (H. sabdariffa) is a plant that contains high antioxidants. This study aim to explore the effect of OT on rat heart oxidative stress levels and the effect of giving H. sabdariffa to oxidative stress in OT rats. The study was an experimental study using 25 adult Wistar rats, 8–10 weeks, 300–350 gr, randomized into five groups: Control (C), Control + Hibiscus (C-Hib), Aerobic Exercise (A), Overtraining (OT) and Overtraining + Hibiscus (OT-Hib). Dosage of H. sabdariffa given: 500 mg / kg / day. Aerobic physical exercise (A) was given 2x/wk, 10min, 12 m/min, lasted for 11 wks. Overtraining protocols was given 5x/wk with increasing frequency and decreasing recovery time between sessions for 11 wks. Calculated levels of MDA, SOD and GSH using spectrophotometry and Nox2 using ELISA at the end of Week 11. The result showed that overtraining can lead to oxidative stress in the rat’s heart characterized by higher MDA levels than aerobic and control rats and lower GSH levels compared to aerobic rats. The administration of H. sabdariffa has the potential to reduce oxidative stress levels in overtraining rat’s heart, characterized by lower MDA levels and higher GSH levels in overtraining rats given H. sabdariffa compared to overtraining rats.",

In these days, users often use notebook computer in public places or external environments where no adjustable workstation is provided because the design of laptop which are portable, lightweight, and space saving. Furthermore, the design of laptop where the display is connected with the input device causes poorer posture to the user. Electromyography (EMG) was used to investigate the upper trapezius, cervical erector spinae, sternocleidomastoid, extensor digitorum and extensor carpi ulnaris muscle activities when using notebook with different inclines (0°, 12°, 25° and 30°). Head-neck posture is measured with craniocervical angle to assess the improved posture formed through applying different inclines in notebook usage. The perceived discomfort, comfort, and ease of use by the computer users were also evaluated followed by calculating the efficiency of the typing task in each incline. Based on the EMG result, the 12° induced the less overall muscle activity of the muscles examined. This result was also supported by the respondents’ subjective valuation of the inclines. Even though bigger incline offer more improved head-neck posture, it doesn’t correspond with the muscle activity result as well as the subjective valuation. Therefore, this study suggest the utilization of 12° when using laptop to improve posture and reduce the risk of any musculoskeletal disorder.",

      "abstract": "Lionfish (Pterois volitans) is a native species of Indo-Pacific ocean. This species is known as destructive invasive species that invades in many areas. The invasion of Lionfish gives negative impacts on the ecology and economic condition of the invaded areas. Therefore, to reduce the amount of Lionfish in the ocean and to attract people to exploit Lionfish, the study about Lionfish’s benefit is necessary. The recent study revealed that venom extract from Lionfish spines has potential cytolytic effect that is widely used for antitumor studies. In this study, to obtain the optimum concentration of the solvent that used for protein isolation and to observe the antitumor properties of Lionfish further, we isolated the protein of Lionfish venom extract with ammonium sulphate and tested it on HeLa cell as the model of tumor cells. The Lowry and BSLT test showed that the highest protein concentration and activity is obtained when crude venom were isolated by the highest concentration of ammonium sulphate. However, the number of percentage of inhibition on HeLa cells that caused by Lionfish venom were not really high. This is caused by protein that contained in the protein isolate. SDS-PAGE results showed that there are several protein with different effects on tumor cells contained in the protein isolate of Lionfish venom. These results suggest that Lionfish has an antitumor effect, but needs further purification step and more evaluation about the protein in Lionfish venom extract that can enhance antitumor effect.",

      "abstract": "Emotion classification are rapidly gain popularity in research world, especially in healthcare field. EEG signal used as emotion classification will provide wider range of information rather using any other type signal, yet need more complex processing to be completed because of its dimensions and noises. ANN used as one of many techniques to classify emotion, using DEAP’s EEG dataset this research will provide high recognition rate of 2-dimensional emotion classification which is based on EEG’s non-linear features including every frequency bands in EEG signal except delta rhythm which produced as the subjects sleep. In this research, PCA play a big role in computational optimization and provide higher number of recognition rate up to 60,15%. To achieve this recognition rate, the system is given an additional part which is BP-NN as data train’s correction, so training rate will be on its maximum. Through this correlation, we will analyze the correlation of those addition for emotional classification. And result from this paper will gave possibility of further research in emotional classification using BP-NN as correction factor of recognition rate.",

      "abstract": "Neuropathic (nerve) pain is caused by damage, dysfunction or injury of nerves it will affect patients’ quality of life because of chronicity and intensity. The pharmaceutical drug commonly used to treat neuropathic pain is antidepressants. However, Anti-depressant drug has dangerous side effects if consumed continuously. Herbs treatments use throughout the world for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Jamu Neuropathic Pain Reducer, which consists of aqueous multi herbs extract of nutmeg seed (Myristica fragrans), clove bud (Syzygium aromaticum) and red ginger rhizome (Zingiber Officinale var Rubrum) was extracted with variation temperature (60, 80, 100℃). This study aimed to figure out the total phenolic content (TPC) in the Jamu Neuropathic Pain Reducer used the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The highest TPC (1.43±1.473 mg GAE/L) happened at temperature 80℃. UPLC-QTOF-MS applied to identify the major bioactive compound in Jamu Neuropathic Pain Reducer extract used temperature extraction 80℃, the analysis revealed the presence of compounds such as adenine, chlorogenic acid, miquelianin, quercitrin, 6-gingerol, myristicin, and eugenol. Jamu Neuropathic Pain Reducer reduced the immobility duration compared with the control group (distilled water) (p<0.001). The reductions of the immobility time were 8.3%, 36.4% and 30.1% for doses 16.25 mL/kg, 32.5 mL/kg and 65 mL/kg, therefore, Jamu Neuropathic Pain Reducer had the potential to be an antidepressant-like activity as herbal medicine for neuropathic pain that safer, less expensive alternative to pharmaceuticals, and has minimum side effect.",

      "abstract": "Background: Osteoporosis is major global health problem and its complication especially compression fracture of spine has become burden of physical function in postmenopausal women and elderly. Screw loosening and pulling out are still major issue in pedicle screw placement in osteoporotic bone. Objectives: to investigate various types of pedicle screw and cement augmentation used in osteoporotic bone. Literature Review: various study about pedicle screw have been investigated. Pedicle screw using expandable pedicle screw (EPS), cannulated pedicle and fenestrated pedicle screw with cement augmentation, and anchor type of pedicle screw show excellent outcomes in biomechanical studies (pulllout, insertional torque), micro-CT analysis, and histological analysis compared to conventional solid pedicle screw. There is no study comparing each type of these screw. PMMA cement augmentation is superior than cement-based augmentation but it shows more complication than calcium based-cement. Hydroxyapatite (HA) have shown better pullout force six times higher than solid screw without augmentation but there is no comparation study between PMMA and HA. Conclusion: Fenestrated and cannulated pedicle screw with cement augmentation, expandable pedicle screw, and anchor type pedicle screw with various type of augmentation shows benefit in osteoporotic bone screw placement.",

      "abstract": "Microencapsulation is a promising technology for improving stem cell therapy and tissue regeneration. Our previous work proposed the use of microencapsulation technology for improving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In the current work, we developed a novel method for encapsulating human umbilical cord-derived stem cells with alginate-chitosan hydrogel. The cells were entrapped in ionic cross-linked alginate beads based on a conventional method. It was noticed that alginate beads were easily dissolved in saline solution or culture medium, suggesting poor stability in the desirable stem cell environment. Therefore, a double layer microcapsule was developed by coating the alginate gel with glutaraldehyde cross-linked chitosan. Our results showed that double layer alginate-chitosan microcapsule remained stable after 3 weeks in the culture medium. Measurement of relative swelling ratio showed that the double layer gel could expand 0.5±0.2 in saline solution. A homogenous cell distribution could be visualized in solid core alginate microcapsule by a DNA staining. Moreover, it was clearly shown that the outer chitosan layer was cell-free, meaning that the proposed technique can be used to fabricate microencapsulated hematopoietic stem cells for preventing immune rejection in allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances on tissue engineering application for medical intervention has created a need for three-dimensional (3D) cellular microenvironment in the form of cellular microencapsulation. Cellular microencapsulation could be used in several applications such as in vitro drug screening as well as cellular transplantation. It is important to note, however, that despite all the benefit from the cells, the capsule itself also has a major role. Significant heldback and even clinical risks could present if the capsule is not biocompatible or even toxic. Hence, careful consideration on the materials and more importantly the fabrication process of the capsule is needed. In this paper we presented a method for cellular encapsulation using oil immersion technique. Briefly, suspension of K562 cells and collagen was injected into the mineral oil on a cell strainer. Microcapsule then washed with PBS and immersed with culture medium. Photomicrograph analysis was performed to evaluate the shape as well as to measure the volume of the microcapsule. Immunohistochemistry staining with Propidium Iodide (PI) was used to confirm K562 entrapment within the microcapsule. Cellular microencapulation using oil immersion technique resulted in a rounded sphere. Increased volume of cells-hydrogel suspension resulted on bigger diameter and volume of the capsule. Due to the nature of the immersion process, a layer of oil could be found outside the capsule. The volume of the oil on the border of the capsule also increased with higher hydrogel-cells suspension. PI-postive K562 cells were found within the microcapsule, confirming that K562 cells were indeed entrapped within the microcapsule. In conclusion, oil immersion technique provides a quick, easy, and feasible method to produce cellular microencapsulation.",

A combination of herbs consisting of tanjung leaves (Mimusops elengi L.), starfruit leaves (Averrhoa carambola L.), and temulawak (Curcuma xanthorrhiza R.) are empirically believed to have an anti-atherosclerotic effect, as they contain quercetin, a potential flavonoid with anti-inflammatory properties. An anti-inflammatory activity test was conducted using the in vivo method on white male rats of the Sprague-Dawley strain, which were carrageenan 1%-induced and divided into five groups: a negative control (Na CMC 0.5%); a positive control (sodium diclofenac 2%); dosage I (2.7 mL of herb extract/200 g body weight); dosage II (3.6 mL of herb extract/200 g body weight), and dosage III (4.5 mL of herb extract/200 g body weight). To begin, 24 grams of anti-atherosclerotic herbs in 60<D<16 mesh powder were extracted using 600 mL solvent with the reflux method, and its anti-inflammatory activity was tested based on the herbs’ ability in rat paw oedema inhibition. The results show that all the herb dosages had the ability to inhibit oedema formation, with the highest oedema inhibition percentage obtained with dosage III (4.5 mL of herb extract/200 g body weight) at 23.11%, thus equaling the positive control inhibition percentage (23.81%).

A quercetin concentration test was conducted using aluminium chloride colorimetric assay with variations in particle size (simplicia, 60<D<16 mesh powder, and D≤60 mesh powder) and herb mass, and employing the extraction method (reflux and infusion). Herbs with 60<D<16 mesh size and D≤60 mesh powder were extracted by infusion in 200 mL solvent, and leaf herbs were extracted by reflux in 600 mL solvent. The results show that increases in extracted herb mass related to increasing quercetin concentration. Moreover, quercetin concentration in the leaves (459.91 ppm) was almost equal to that for 2.4 gram herbs in 60<D<16 mesh powder (489.09 ppm). The highest total flavonoid content was achieved in 2.4 gram 60<D<16 mesh herb powder with 41.508 mg QE (Quercetin Equivalent)/g. Therefore, it can be concluded that anti-atherosclerosis herbs contain quercetin.",

      "abstract": "An unhealthy lifestyle could trigger increased levels of cholesterol, hypertension, and obesity, even atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is hardening and tightening of the arteries that cause blocking of blood circulation. Anti-atherosclerosis herbs consist of tanjung leaf (Mimusops elengi L.), starfruit leaf (Averrhoa carambola L.), and temulawak (Curcuma xanthorrhiza R.) are empirically believed has antioxidant, anti-cholesterol, antiplatelets, and anti-hyperglycemic activity. Since anti-atherosclerosis herbs are going to be mass-produced, packaging and herbs stability must be considered carefully to preserve flavonoid content within. Therefore, expired date statement on food packaging is mandatory according to UU No.18/2012 about food and PP No. 69/1999 about food labeling and advertising. The shelf life of anti-atherosclerosis herbs was estimated by accelerated shelf life test (ASLT) method based on the critical water content approach and sorption isotherms model (Labuza equation). In the study, the organoleptic test and mold test were carried out as well to determine critical condition. Packaging permeability was a parameter in Labuza equation and was measured by the gravimetric method. The results of this study, the shelf life of anti-atherosclerosis herbs was predicted to be 233 days in filter bag & aluminum foil packaging when it stored at a temperature of 30⁰C and relative humidity (RH) of 75%.",

The EHD process reduces the water level of materials through a coronal wind by placing them between two electrodes that conduct a strong electric field. In this study, EHD is applied using needles with copper plates as the two electrodes. High voltage applied to EHD is 15,000-volt direct current. Within the same surface area, different numbers of needles (2×2, 3×3, and 4×4) are arranged to conduct the positive charge using the copper plate as the grounding system. By using various numbers of needles and modifying the gap between them and the material, the effect of the EHD process on the material, namely amoxicillin powder, is determined. Based on the experimental results, a 2×2 needle arrangement and 2-cm gap between the needles and the sample have the fastest drying speed as compared to other needle numbers and gaps.",

      "abstract": "Humans are continually exposed to external impulses, both physical (direct) and emotional (indirect). Sweat can be secreted by the nervous system as a response system. The presence of sweat changes skin conductivity. For this study a device was developed to measure skin conductivity and its activity when physical and emotional impulses were introduced. The physical impulse was a mild punch to the arm, and the emotional impulse was prompted by watching a video that contained an element of surprise. Measurement was delayed by 10 seconds to let the body rest before receiving the physical impulse, and after another 10 seconds, the emotional impulse was introduced. Total time taken for the measurement was 45 seconds. An analysis was conducted to compare the change in dry skin conductivity with the change in conductivity in skin that was already sweating. Measurement results revealed that changes in dry skin conductivity are more pronounced than changes in sweating skin conductivity. The study also demonstrated that a delay of 3.05 to 5 seconds exists between physical impulse and response, but no delay is present between emotional impulse and response.",

      "abstract": "Advances in microfabrication has led to the development of microbioreactor including microheater as one of important components for microbioreactor. Microheater should be fabricated based on specific requirement of microbioreactor including shape, size, target working temperature, and heating rate profile, where they would determine the heat distribution to the microbioreactor. Here, we propose serpentine-shaped and spiral-shaped microheaters for a dynamic-flow microbioreactor. Computer models were generated and characterized by finite element analysis (FEA) to simulate the heating performance. Microheaters were then fabricated by maskless photolithography using visible light generated by a commercial digital light projector (DLP) followed by wet etching. Geometrical features of fabricated microheaters were then measured to characterize the design transfer. FEA result shows that given same amount of input electrical power and observation time, both microheaters have different heat distribution profiles which could affect the heating control scheme. Geometrical measurement on certain segments shows that the current fabrication technique can transfer the design with dimensional error percentage of 0.5 to 39 % without significance change in the geometrical shape.",

This research revolves around the steps taken to comply with the CISPR 11 and CISPR 22 standards. Different methods and materials were used in combinations and are tested to observe the improvement in bringing the device to comply with electromagnetic safety standards. Moreover, this research would aid others who are trying to design their own medical device into fruition. Thus, give basis for them to try and experiment with their own set of radiation shielding.",

      "abstract": "As various international and government institutions have decreed that electronic devices must adhere to electromagnetic safety standards before they enter the market, electromagnetic shielding has become an important aspect in design considerations. Various materials at different price points have certain characteristics that may cause them to become either optimal or ill-fitting for certain applications however, testing their shielding capability can be difficult without the expensive equipment in testing facilities. In this paper, a handheld electromagnetic (EM) meter was used in a simplified test set up to assess the shielding effectiveness of 6 shielding materials: silver sleeve, steel mesh, conductive ABS, Al tape, and Al metallised film. Silver sleeve, Al tape, and Al metallised film were chosen to shield a robotic medical device based on their shielding capability, cost effectiveness, and design flexibility. The CISPR 11 radiated emissions test results of the robotic medical device validated the shielding effectiveness of the materials chosen showing that the handheld EM meter was able to assess the materials’ shielding capability.",

      "abstract": "This study presents a formal description of typical compartmental epidemic models by splitting the state into an, infective sub-state (or infective compartment) and a non-infective sub-state (or non-infective compartment). Then, the, linearized infective part is discussed from a positivity /stability point of view from linear algebraic tools. The Perron, root of a defined relevant next generation matrix characterizes the stability of the disease-free equilibrium point if it is, strictly less than one. Such a Perron root is the disease basic reproduction number It is assumed that the minus, transition matrix of the infective components of the linearized system around the disease-free equilibrium point is a, non-singular M -matrix with positive inverse (then, a stability matrix) and the corresponding transmission matrix is, also positive. It turns out that such matrices are the Jacobians of the nonlinear system around the disease-free, equilibrium point. It is used for stability analysis that a Metzler stability matrix has a minus positive inverse and, vice-versa. The problem is studied in the delay-free case and then extended to the presence of point delays.",

The ABCD method, which is common to be used as a melanoma diagnosis method, has been shown to have inappropriate weighting for each parameter. In addition, pattern analysis has been shown to have a higher success for diagnosing melanoma. In this paper, we choose the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) as a texture parameter to represent the pattern of melanoma. We also choose Deep Neural Network (DNN) to retrieve information from the data set. DNN has a capability of analyzing data with a high level of abstraction, therefore we choose DNN as a method to classify melanoma and nevus. We use the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) archive database as our training and validation data. We use 773 nevi with 870 melanoma images as training data and a separate 200 Nevus and 200 Melanoma images as validation data. We achieve a diagnostic accuracy of 81.75%, 75.5% sensitivity and 88% specificity.",

      "abstract": "Currently, the development of a magnesium-based biodegradable implant material is a matter of concern to many researchers. In this study, the sintering process and extrusion process on Mg/5Carbonate Apatite (Mg/5CA) as a result of powder metallurgy were conducted. Moreover, pure magnesium was also manufactured using the same process as a comparator. Then, test results of density, XRD, OM microstructure, micro XRF and rod hardness distribution were investigated. The results showed that the hot extrusion process on Mg/5CA increased the relative density up to 98.231%. No other phases were found such as MgO. CA reinforcement was spread evenly on the formed Mg composite. The hardness obtained was in the range of 39.1-44 Hv. The hardness distribution along the rod was relatively homogeneous for the 28-mm-long rod. On the other hand, the sintered rod showed a decrease in the hardness distribution towards the end of the rod. The hardness of the sintered rods ranged from 23.6 to 40.1 Hv for a 20-mm-long rod. The hot extrusion process is deemed more suitable than the conventional atmospheric sinter process as part of the process of developing Mg/CA for implant materials.",

The result of microstructures investigation confirm that the pores in the alloy has the size approximately arround 200 μm. The result of Archimedes testing, indicate the porosity of specimen about 40%. mechanical properties were tested in compression. The presence of pores will affect the compressive strength of the sample. the more pore, the compressive strength will be decrease. but the results are still within the standard range of human bones.",

      "abstract": "Bone scaffold is susceptible to infection in its application due to the bacteria that often appear on the surface. To prevent this phenomenon, the scaffolds need to be modified in order to provide antibacterial properties. In this study, bone scaffold was fabricated from chitosan-collagen with the addition of zinc oxide as antibacterial agent. There were four variables of the amount of zinc oxide added to the scaffold: 0%, 1%, 3%, and 5%. The method used was Thermally Induced Phase Separation (TIPS). From this study, porous scaffold with rough surface was obtained. SEM image of the scaffold showed that more zinc oxide caused smaller pore and lower porosity. Characterization with FTIR proved that the scaffold obtained from this process has the same functional group as chitosan and collagen. The DSC-TGA curve confirmed that heating process performed on dehydrothermal treatment (DHT) did not cause degradation of the scaffold because chitosan and collagen have higher degradation temperatures than DHT temperatures. In addition, this study also proved that the addition of zinc oxide had successfully provided the scaffold with antibacterial properties in which the protection against bacteria was related to the amount of zinc oxide in direct proportion.",

      "abstract": "The multispectral imaging technique has been used for skin analysis, especially for distant mapping of in-vivo two major skin chromophores: melanin and blood. Previously, we have developed a new LED-based MSI system. Our MSI system captures only 11 monoband images of human skin which is too little for providing an accurate diagnostic information. We implemented artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm to retrieve a hyperspectral reflectance cube between 380 and 880 nm with a 5 nm resolution. In this paper, we present the validation results our MSI’s performance in order to estimate melanin and blood content in human skin. Validation is done by comparing the estimation results captured by the MSI system and the spectrometer with diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) technique. For validation, we used agar-based phantom as object. In addition, we also present the results of in vivo testing in uper human palm skin with 5 samples. The results of melanin content estimation using MSI system and the spectrometer follows the equation y = 0.9565x with the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9934. On the other hand, the result of the blood content estimation follows the equation y = 1.1881x with the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9226. The average melanin content estimate results with the MSI system was 1.29% greater than the spectrometer, while the average blood content was 1.06% higher for the same in vivo skin data test. With these findings, the developed MSI could be further used for the direct and noninvasive assessment of melanin and blood content on the skin accurately. For example, measurement of melanin content in the skin is the most essential in the skin diagnosis process, especially in cases of hypo-pigmentation and hyper-pigmentation. In other cases, some cancers such as melanoma, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and tumor can also be differentiated by measurement of melanin and blood content.",

Ethanol extract from Acalypha indica has been known to alleviate hyperglycemic and hyperuricemic conditions in rats induced by substances that destroy beta cells. This research aim to evaluate its effect in rats induced by diet. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into seven groups, six of which are given HFHC diet for 1,5 month. In the following month, rats were given therapy while diet was continued. Therapy consists of 250 mg/kgBW/day of Acalypha indica Linn. root’s ethanol extract, 100 mg/kgBW/day of metformin, 30mg/kgBW/day of allopurinol, or combination. Lowest blood glucose value is found in group receiving both AI and metformin. No significant difference is found between pre- and post- therapy blood glucose in groups treated with AI (p=0,831), metformin (p=0,056), or both (p=0,908). Uric acid level is increased in all groups, with highest rate found in group receiving both allopurinol and AI. The difference in uric acid level between treatment group is 0.331. Whilst insignificant, ethanolic extract of Acalypha indica Linn. is observed to lower blood glucose in rats. Group treated with AI showed similar rise in uric acid level, with combination therapy showed highest rise.Further research with longer duration of induction and therapy is required to better understand the hypoglycemic and antihyperuricemic effects exerted by AI.",

Chitosan-alginate coated microparticle of Garcinia mangostana Linn extract promises an alternative treatment of colon cancer patients, as the component of Garcinia mangostana Linn extract has anticancer activity in colon cancer cell lines, and chitosan-alginate could deliver compound faster to colon and accelerate its absorption. However, there have not been any studies evaluating sub-acutely the toxicity effects of this compound on the liver (SGOT and SGPT) and clinical signs of toxicity. This study was designed to assess the subacute toxicity effect of oral administration of Chitosan-alginate coated microparticle of Garcinia mangostana Linn extract. Fifty BALB/c mice were divided into five groups, including doses of 0.5 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 2.0 mg/kg, negative control, and normal group. Each rat was given an extract by force-feeding via intragastric tube for 14 days (subacute). The results showed that differences in SGOT level (p = 0.061), SGPT level (p = 0.82), and weight gain (p = 0.076) were not significant between the treatment and control groups, accompanied by the absence of clinical signs during the study. These indicate that subacute administration of chitosan-alginate coated microparticle of Garcinia mangostana Linn extract is safe until a dose of 2.0 mg/kgBW. Further studies are needed to evaluate the toxicity effects of this extract on other parameters and in a longer duration of exposure.",

      "abstract": "Lionfish (Pterois volitans) is classified as an invasive species that has no natural predators that are predators native to the Indo-Pacific region. Lionfish growth fast, making these fish prey on much other fish and make Lionfish cause a lot of damage to the marine ecosystem. This research does determine the antioxidant potential of lionfish spines venom by isolating the protein from the extract. In previous research, it was stated that lionfish poison extract had the potential as an antioxidant, but it was still very weak. To find out the potential further, the additional isolation step is heating. Crude venom (CV) was extracted using sonication and isolated by heating at 90, 75 and 60 ℃ and fractionated using Ammonium Sulfate (AS) with 20, 40, 60, and 80% saturation. Then the protein concentration was analyzed by the Lowry test and identified the protein content using SDS-PAGE, and toxicity tested using the BSLT method (Brine Shrimp Lethality Test). To test the antioxidant activity carried out using the DPPH method in the final step.",

      "abstract": "The honey quality could predict based on the electrical conductivity. A prediction system based on visual near infrared imaging was developed to predict electrical conductivity value of honey. The electrical conductivity value was standardized using a conductivity meter namely HI 98311 that produced by Hanna Instrument, Rhode Island, USA. The measurement benchwork was build using 40x40 aluminum profile to handle a hyperspectral camera, two halogen lamps, a slider system to move object that put-on Teflon sheet. The data processing consists of image correction, feature extraction, and feature selection, while as the prediction model was built using Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Partial Least Square Artificial Neural Network (PLS-ANN). Hypercube images from 28 honey samples were captured in transmittance mode using hyperspectral camera that has wavelength range of 400-1000 nm. The performance of the prediction system provided by PLSR is 0.88 (correlation coefficient) and 26.20% (RMSE). The ANN has correlation coefficient and RMSE of 0.93 and 23.12%, respectively. The best performance was the PLS-ANN model which has correlation coefficient of 0.98 and RMSE of 12.65%.",

      "abstract": "Abstract.Progesterone (P4) increases on the day of hCG administration in Controlled Ovarian Hyperstimulation (COH) has reduced the rate of pregnancy in Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of the increase in P4 on the day of hCG administration to the expression of progesterone receptor (PR). Method: 16 samples of Macaca nemestrina endometrial tissue, in the form of stored biological materials, originated from groups of natural cycles and cycles stimulated in the COH procedure. For 16 endometrial tissue samples, PR expression was measured by immunohistochemical (CPI) technique. The level of PR expression is compared between the natural cycle and the stimulated cycle that got P4> 1 ng/mL and with P4 <1 ng/mL. Results: PR expression was detected in three endometrial compartments, glandular cells, epithelial luminal cells and stroma. Semi-quantitative analysis used the formula H_SCORE = Σpi (i + 1). PR expression in the gland epithelium from natural cycle group and stimulated cycle with P4> 1 ng / mL and P4 <1ng / mL respectively 2.85 vs, 2.82 vs 2.43. The Kruskal Wallis test, PR expression in the glandular epithelium in the three groups was statistically different (P <0.05). PR expression in and between P4 <1 ng / mL with P4> 1 ng / mL in the stimulated cycle, it did not differ statistically (P => 0.05). Then, PR expression between P4 in the natural cycle with P4 <1 ng / mL in the stimulated cycle there was no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05). PR expression in the luminal epithelium and stroma, between natural cycles and stimulated cycles was not significantly different (P> 0.05). Conclusion, the level of P4 > 1 ng / mL on the day of administration of hCG in the COH procedure decreases PR expression in the endometrial gland.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Degenerative diseases due to damaged articular cartilage in hip, knee, hip and other body parts requires suitable materials need to repair the damaged tissue. Therefore, the regenerative technology involving tissue engineering is needed as one of the available alternatives. Tissue engineering generally develops stem cells or adult tissue cells as a source of cells. Stem cells can be seeded in a scaffold, which is a supporting material during cell regeneration process until new tissue is formed. One of the most readily available sources of multipotent stem cell is from Wharton's jelly (Wharton's jelly derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells / WJ-MSCs) which can be induced to chondrocytes. Protein-based scaffolds such as fibroin (SF) from silkworms and spidroin (SS) from spiders (Argiope sp.) can be developed and applied to repair damaged tissues, since the materials are biodegradable and also biocompatible. Biocompatibility test showed that the scaffolds made SF mixed with SS were not toxic to WJ-MSC cells. Scaffold with SS 10% mixed with SF 90% is able to support cell proliferation better than silk fibroin scaffold 100%. The supplementation of platelet rich plasma (PRP) and ascorbic acid (LAA) on hWJ were able to increase cell proliferation ability, which is one of important steps in chondrogenic differentiation. PRP with a concentration of 10% (v/v) and LAA with a concentration of 50 μg/ml can increase cell proliferation rate better than other concentration variations. Cell attachment through vinculin expression observed with Immunocytochemistry (ICC), the results showed that spidroin affected cell attachment to scaffold.",

      "abstract": "Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) DNA presence in the serum of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients indicates the existence of the viral DNA in the circulation and may be used as an early marker in NPC diagnosis. EBV DNA isolated from the serum and then amplified by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) could be used to assess the response of the DNA to various NPC therapies. This study compares the results of EBV DNA measurement in the serum of NPC patients using photoelectrochemical technique and PCR. The presence of a specific oligonucleotide sequence of a standard DNA (EBNA-1) may be detected by photoelectrochemical hybridization of the standard with a DNA probe immobilized on TiO2 electrode, in which the DNA is intercalated by an electrochromic material., The purpose of this study is to obtain a photoelectrochemical system with a relatively good response and sensitivity to the changes in the concentration of EBV DNA in the peripheral blood serum of NPC patients. This research attempts to provide a device and methods that are simple, relatively inexpensive and easy to use, yet sensitive enough to see the prognosis of NPC patients. This study also attempts to develop the measurement instrumentation technology in the field of biomedical research., The photoelectrochemical system of this research used anthocyanin as DNA intercalator. The anthocyanin was isolated from purple cabbage leaves (also known as red cabbage), strawberries, and grapes and the extractant of these anthocyanins were ethanol and water., The best extraction with the highest level of total anthocyanin was achieved by alcohol as extractant. Alcohol gave higher yield of anthocyanin compared to water and ethyl acetate. Purple cabbage leaves have the highest level of anthocyanin compared to strawberry fruits and grapes. ,  Anthocyanins contained in the extract of purple cabbage, strawberries and grapes may function as DNA intercalator. Electrochromic substance used as DNA intercalator produces difference between the current strength generated by photoelectrochemical system with light and without light. There is a very strong correlation between diluted concentration of DNA and current strength shown by the electrochemical system of this study. There is also correlation between EBV EBNA-1 DNA concentration readings by using photoelectrochemical system and PCR.

      "abstract": "Endometriosis is one of the most common gynecological abnormalities. Endometriosis cyst in the ovary also exhibited changes in epithelial cyst just like endometrium in the uterus. Nowadays, there are some research that linked endometriosis and clear cell ovarian cancer which is known with endometriosis-associated ovarian carcinoma (EAOC). It is reported that there’s a mutation that activated tumor suppressor gene (ARID1A), so protein BAF250a is not expressed in Clear Cell Carcinoma (CCC) in the ovarium. Immunohistochemistry staining of ARID1Awere done in 20 samples of non-atypical endometriosis, 20 cases of atypical endometriosis, 20 cases of CCC in the ovarium from 2012 until march 2015. From the CCC we get 9 cases of EAOC. After that, we see if there’s any difference in the percentage of ARID1A expression in non-atypical, atypical endometriosis, CCC in the ovarium and endometriosis with CCC( EAOC)., In non-atypical, atypical endometriosis and CCC groups there are significant differences on the percentage of ARID1A expression (Kruskal-Walis test p=0.0035). There are significant differences on ARID1Aexpression between non-atypical and atypical endometriosis with EAOC (p=0.001 and p=0.0015).In non-atypical, atypical endometriosis and CCC there are significant differences on the percentage of ARID1A expression (Kruskal-Walis test p=0.011). There are significant differences on ARID1Aexpression between non-atypical and atypical endometriosis with EAOC (p=0.005 and p=0.008). The expression of ARID1A in non atypical and atypical endometriosis are significantly higher than ovarian CCC and EAOC. ARID1A may be used as a marker for malignancy transformation in endometriosis.",

The invasion of Lionfish was not accompanied by the presence of predators, thus causing damage to the ecosystem and food chain. One of the control efforts that can be done is the utilization of venomous spines of Lionfish that contains Phospholipase A2 known to have antiretroviral activity. So it has the potential to be used as an alternative treatment of HIV/AIDS infection. This research aims to increase the purity and specific activity of phospholipase A2 from venomous spines of Lionfish in Java Sea, Indonesia. The result by precipitation method of protein using 20% Ammonium Sulfate and the addition of 0.5 mL of Caprylic Acid by being given 60°C for 20 minutes was effective to purify Phospholipase A2 from extract of Lionfish venomous spines with specific activities reaching 6.48 units/μg, has the highest purity level with protein bands at the molecular weight level around 95kDa and safely tested on human cells with 28.36 ppm inhibition results measured with LC50.",

      "abstract": "Antibacterial soap is the most popular soap in Indonesia as a cleaning agent. Unfortunately, antibacterial soap has some issues, such as the antibacterial ingredients used. Antibacterial ingredients commonly used in soaps, such as triclosan, triclocarban and others, have been banned from use by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) because they are dangerous for long-term use. However, antibacterial soap is still needed in places that have high levels of bacterial spread, such as hospitals. For this reason, we need safe antibacterial ingredients for long and short term use. Microalgae Spirulina platensis is one of microalgae that contains safe antibacterial compound. In addition, these types of microalgae have other compounds that are very beneficial for skin. Besides the ingredients, the form of soap also needs to be considered to avoid bacterial contamination. The form of soap with a thin layer is the right form to solve this problem. This research aims to obtain the optimal saponification reaction temperature of VCO and microalgae Spirulina platensis based antibacterial soap. The variation of reaction temperature used is 50, 60 and 70oC. Based on quality, soap that made of 70oC is the best sample with 13.87% of water, 0.281 of free fatty acid and minimum inhibitory value 0 or no bacteria growth until 25% of dilution.",

Several commercial antibacterial soap in Indonesia still use triclosan and triclocarban as antibacterial agent. This has been a problem since they have been banned by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2017 because can cause irregulation in human reproduction system. This study utilizes Spirulina platensis as ingredient and virgin coconut oil (VCO) as antibacterial agent for making film-formed soap. Film-formed is expected to lessen soap and water waste. This soap was made by the hot process method at a temperature of 65℃. The examination done were free alkali, free fatty acid values, pH values, water content and antibacterial activity toward S. aureus. The result showed that all sample meet the SNI standard of hard soap. The use of VCO can substitute chemical-based antibacterial agent in soap because it has same ability in killing S. aureus in soap (at 25% dilution). The optimum composition in soap making were found in the use of 1 g S. platensis.",

During wound healing, keratinocytes migrate from basal area to cover the lesion area. The important role of keratinocytes in skin regeneration triggers interests to isolate and expand the cells in vitro. This study was attempted to compare briefly enzymatic and non-enzymatic keratinocytes isolation. Non-enzymatic based keratinocyte isolation through explant culture allowed minimal sample preparation, however, the process required longer preparation time in which the target cells typically appears after 2 weeks culturing period. Meanwhile, enzymatic-based keratinocyte isolation required more complex procedure with relatively shorter preparation time. It is likely that explant method produced higher purity of keratinocytes as compared with direct digestion method, as analyzed from cytokeratin 14 expression. Moreover, it was noticed that mechanical force during enzymatic digestion was critical for keratinocyte’s purity.",

The synthesis was resulted in bone scaffold in the form of interconnected porous structure. Tests carried out were Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray (EDX), and antibacterial Test. SEM-EDX results showed porous morphology with an average size of 68.32 µm in bone scaffold without AgNO3 and 16.66 µm in bone scaffold with the addition of AgNO3. Antibacterial testing showed that the greater the concentration of silver nitrate used, the greater the diameter of the inhibitory zone produced.",

Prior study has also shown that alpha-mangostin ameliorates alcohol’s toxic effect in hepatic stellate cells in vitro; however, whether alpha-mangostin exerts its effect by inducing apoptosis is still unknown. The purpose of this study was to analyze the apoptotic properties of alpha-mangostin in acetaldehyde-induced hepatic stellate cells in vitro., Methods: , Immortalized human hepatic stellate (HSC) cells with LX2 cell line were treated with acetaldehyde in the presence or absence of alpha-mangostin (10 and 20 μM). After treatments, cells were harvested, isolated for RNA, and analyzed for mRNA expressions of apoptotic markers: Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3, and caspase-9 using qRT-PCR., Results: , Acetaldehyde treatment caused a significant reduction in the mRNA expressions of Bax and caspase-3 and a slight decrease in the expressions of caspase-9. The addition of alpha-mangostin increased the mRNA expressions of Bax, caspase-9, and caspase-3 significantly. Increased mRNA expressions of Bcl-2 in alpha-mangostin-treated cells were observed. These effects displayed a dose-dependent tendency., Conclusion: , Alpha-mangostin demonstrates apoptotic activity in acetaldehyde-induce hepatic stellate cells in a dose-dependent manner.",

In this study, Chitosan-magnetite materials were synthesized through mixing process of both compounds and activated with glutaraldehyde. The synthesized chitosan-magnetite were characterized with Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The enzyme activity was tested with oxidation reaction and quantified with High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The results were compared between free enzyme and immobilized enzyme. The substrate concentration that used in this study was 2.5 mg/mL. For determining the effect of enzyme concentration, here we used different concentration of enzyme in order to get the best condition of operation. The concentrations of enzyme were 0.5 mg/mL; 1 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL. The best condition in oxidation reaction was immobilized enzyme with 2 mg/mL concentration of enzyme. The result showed that immobilized enzyme significantly decreased the substrate concentration until reach 0.1 value.",

Due to its hidrophylic properties, it was estimated that the uptake of primaquine to its target (liver) to be very difficult. This study was aimed to study the mechanism of primaquine uptake to the hepatocytes through the transport protein, OCT1 (organic cationic transporter 1)., Methods, This is an in vitro study using HepG2 cells. The HepG2 cells were propagated in vitro following the procedure published previously. The intracellular concentrations of primaquine was quantified using HPLC coupled with photodiode array detection (HPLC-PDA). The mRNA expression of OCT1 was determined using quantitative RT-PCR. In order to determine whether the uptake of primaquine to the hepatocytes were transported by OCT1, we quantify intracellular primaquine concentrations and analyze the mRNA OCT1 expressions in the cells treated with primaquine +/- OCT1 inhibitor (quinidine). , Results, OCT1 inhibitor (quinidine) decreased the intracellular primaquine concentrations significantly at almost all the concentrations investigated. The exposure of primaquine with quinidine consistently reduced the expression of OCT1 mRNA compared with primaquine alone. , Discussions, In HepG2 cells, primaquine is efficiently transported by OCT1. OCT1 is thought to be one of the target protein in order to increase the uptake of primaquine to the hepatocytes.",

      "abstract": "The number of people with Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) in the DKI Jakarta province continues to increase, eventhough there is number of efforts to control the spread of DHF from the government. An example of this control method is the use of chemical-based fogging. Besides this insecticide able to cause resistance and side effects to the human body, its use in fogging requires the addition of petroleum fuels as forming smoke. This study intends to formulate fluids used for fogging in residential areas. This formulation aims to create liquid fogging products for fogging that are free from pyrethroid and petroleum so that it is safer for users. The research was done by formulating tobacco leaf extract as an active insecticide substance with a solvent in the form of propylene glycol and glycerin as a smoke-making agent. The independent variables in this study were the concentration of the active substance and the ratio of solvent (PG: VG). Tests that will be conducted on the samples that have been made are LC50 toxicity test, and stability test (physical stability test), organoleptic test, GCMS test. The results of the Aedes aegypti fogging fluid efficiency test with pyrolysis showed that with a concentration of 10% -20% it has not reached LC50, the concentration of 30% reached LC 50 in the 9th minute. The concentration of 40% reached LC50 in the 6th minute and the concentration of 50% reached LC50 in the 5th minute. For tobacco extract with extraction method, the concentration of 5% -20% has not reached LC 50. The concentration of 30% reaches LC50 in the 9th minute. The concentration of 40% reached LC50 in the 4th minute and the concentration of 50% in the 3rd minute",

The pathogenesis and treatment of NAFPD are currently not well understood yet. The use of simvastatin in managing pancreatic disease, although was shown to reduce cancer risk, raises concerns as simvastatin was recently found to induce diabetes and worsen hyperglycaemia and A1c levels in pre-existing diabetes. Acalypha indica Linn. (AI) is known to have flavonoids and polyphenols which may decrease LDL and increase HDL level. In contrast to simvastatin, AI may control post-prandial hyperglycaemia. A study on rat induced with high-fructose/high-cholesterol diet showed that AI helped reverse fatty formation in the pancreas, which was not significantly different from the rats given simvastatin. This article reviews the potential use of Acalypha indica Linn. extract as an alternative to modify the risk factors underlying NAFPD.",

Commercial capsule shell with gelatin mostly are made from pig skin and makes Muslim people cannot consume drug with capsule preparation. Therefore, more capsule shell material development is needed, raw material which can be substitute gelatin is carrageenan. However, by using carrageenan is still less effective as a drug delivery agent because is easy to crack. With these problems, to improve performance a capsule shell as a drug delivery agent, Spirulina platensis is needed. To optimize both of material between carrageenan and Spirulina platensis, cross linker is used. The purpose of this study was to use CaCl2 as cross linker to combine the bond between two functional groups and decrease solubility both of material in the water so prolongs the dissolution of the drugs to release into the intestine. The formulation of the solution that used in this research is variation of CaCl2 (0.75%; 1%; 3%; 5%, 7%) (w/v). The characterization was performed by using water content, pH, water resistance, durability in acid solution test and this parameter follow Department of Health Republic of Indonesia. The best concentration of CaCl2 which used in this research is 7% (w/v), with characterization that obtained as follows: water content is 13.52%, resistance in water in 38’09”, resistance in acid environment in 44’54”, and pH is 6.4. This capsule is able to survive in acid condition at pH 1.2 for 75 minutes, with release the drug as much as 61.30%, and then at pH 4.5 release the drug of 54.90%, and pH 6.8 release the drug of 89.58%. The CaCl2 concentration affected to porosity of capsule shell and drug release from inside capsule shell, besides that CaCl2 also effect the absorption ability of capsule shell. By paying attention to these parameters, it is expected that the capsule formed will have strong structural and not easy to dissolution in the water, so that the drug will be released according to the destination organ.",

The six-bar linkage mechanism is adopted for each of the fingers. To govern the movement of the prosthetic hand, a control algorithm is developed where electromyography (EMG) sensors are used to read the muscle activities that will initiate hand movement. To detect whether or not the fingers are already in contact with an object or in a fully extended condition, piezoelectric disc sensors are employed and attached to the fingertips and on the proximal phalange. The prosthetic hand developed in the present work could successfully perform four grip patterns.",

However, terrestrial mammals are susceptible to infectious diseases and pig is restricted in some religions. Thus, there is need to find an alternative non-mammal collagen sources. Aquatic origin collagen has been persuade as an alternative to mammalian origin. However, low denaturation temperature collagen hamper clinical application. Wound dressing with thermal stability are highly desired for burns burns healing. The aims of this work were extraction of collagen Type-I from fish skin (Channa striata) and crosslinking collagen with alginate. Extraction of collagen consist of pretreatment to remove grease, hydrolysis to remove undesirable protein, and extraction to obtain acid-soluble collagen (ASC) by acetic acid 0.5M at 4⁰C. The extracted collagen was characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and SDS PAGE to analyze functional groups and determine collagen Type-I, respectively. Biopolymer was synthesized by crosslinking collagen and cross-linking agent, sodium alginate (SA). Required an optimum concentration of collagen and SA. Biopolymer was characterized for functional groups, micrograph, thermal stability, and biocompability (toxicity). Results reveal, functional groups Amide A (3414 cm-1), Amide I (1637 cm-1), Amide II (1548 cm-1), Amide III (13338 cm-1) refers to collagen Type-I. ASC was successfully extracted from Channa striata and classified as Type-I collagen. This finding shows the potential use of this collagen-based biopolymer as a promising new dressing for burn healing.",

      "abstract": "Aging is physiologic process characterized by degeneration of body functions and an increased in oxidative stress level. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is an oxidative stress marker which concentration will rise along with age. Increased level of MDA is associated with tissue aging and degeneration. In other hands, herbal plants are often used as an alternative medications, believed to contain many useful substances. Acalypha indica (AI) is one of the herbal plant that can be found in many region of Indonesia, therefore AI can be used as a strategic alternative medication considering its availability. As of now, the relationship between AI extract consumption with aging and cognitive function is still unknown. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of ethanolic AI root extract related to aging by measuring: MDA level in brain tissue and long term memory level using Y-maze. 18 old male Sprague-Dawley rats (age 20 – 24 weeks) are divided into 3 groups, which are control group, AI group, and vitamin E group. An additional group consisting of 6 young Sprague-Dawley (age 8 – 12 weeks) rats as negative control. Treatment was given to respective group everday for 4 weeks. On the last day of the experiment, the rats were sacrificed and its brain was collected to measure MDA level. The results of MDA level analysis are 3,776+1,083 nmol/L for control group, 3,695+0,3947 for AI group, 3,118+0,7845 nmol/L for vitamin E group, and 3,704+0,4624 nmol/L for young rats group without any significant difference (p=0,5220). The analysis result for weekly data (p=0,3692 for day 7 and p=0,8943 for day 28) and intergroup data (p=0,5000 for control group; p>0,9999 for AI group, vitamin E group, and young rats group) for long term memory also didn’t show any significant difference. From the results, it can be concluded that AI extract consumption does not able to decrease MDA levels and slow down cognitive decline.",

      "abstract": "Magnesium has been developed as a biodegradable bone implant material due to its similarity in elasticity modulus of bone. However, magnesium has a higher corrosion rate and a lower strength. Gadolinium is alloyed to magnesium in order to improve the corrosion resistance and then rolled to improve the strength due to grain refinement in rolling. Cold roll produced the finest grain, but magnesium has a poor formability. Due to this fact, warm rolling with temperature 247 – 375 oC is applied. Optical Microscope, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and Energy Dispersive Spectrometry (EDS) are used for characterization. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Polarization test were carried out to observe the corrosion mechanism of Mg-Gd in SBF Kokubo to replicate a human body condition. The result of polarization test shows that the cross-rolled sample experienced an increase in E corr, with 0,15 and –0,048 V due to a better distribution of Gadolinium. EIS states that the single pass rolled sample has a stronger passive layer with 116 and 126 kΩ value of Rf due to a smaller grain size which resulted a fewer compression stress. Warm rolling of Mg-1,6Gd decreases the evolution of hydrogen about half portion than as cast samples at 24 hours immersion.",

      "abstract": "Due to high number of bone fracture cases in Indonesia, development of bone scaffold is becoming a solution to improve damaged bone structure. In bone scaffold fabrication, there are several parameters that must be met such as morphology, pore size, and antibacterial properties. One of the antibacterial agents that can be used for bone scaffold is silver nitrate (AgNO3). In this study AgNO3 with various concentrations (0.005, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.1 M) was added in HA-chitosan bone scaffold that was synthesized via freeze drying process. The synthesis was resulted in bone scaffolds in the form of interconnected porous structure. Tests carried out were Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray (EDX), and antibacterial Test. SEM-EDX results showed porous morphology with an average size of 68.32 µm in bone scaffold without AgNO3 and 16.66 µm in bone scaffold with the addition of AgNO3. Antibacterial testing showed that the greater the concentration of silver nitrate used, the greater the diameter of the inhibitory zone produced.",

      "abstract": "Hydroxyapatite (HAp) and chitosan (CS) are known to be suitable to be used as the main matrices in scaffold fabrication due to its biodegradability and biocompatibility. However, biocompatibility contributes to the growth and development of bacteria. Therefore, the properties of these scaffolds can be improved by adding additional substance into the scaffold. In this study, antibacterial property was improved by adding zinc oxide into HAp/CS scaffold with concentration of 1%, 2% and 3% by weight. These scaffolds were prepared by freeze drying techniques in -80 Celcius degree. Chemical analysis, microstructure and phase composition of the scaffolds were investigated using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDX). Antibacterial examination was also carried out to study zinc oxide ability to inhibit bacteria growth in HAp/CS. These scaffolds showed antibacterial efficacy against Escherichia coli. In this analysis, zinc oxide concentration has a linear correlation to antibacterial activity, where each 1%, 2% and 3% ZnO have inhibition diameter zone of 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 mm, respectively. This study showed a simple approach for developing bone scaffold with the addition of zinc oxide to enhance its antibacterial activity.",

      "abstract": "Abstract. Protein kinases are classified into several classes of enzymes that catalyze phosphorylation of proteins and thereby alter their substrate’s activity to interact with other proteins. Many of these enzymes are related to human cancer initiation and progression since many recent developments of small molecule kinase inhibitors has proven successful in diverse type of cancer clinically. Recent studies reported that propolis display variety of biological activities, including anticancer which indicated by the presence of podophyllotoxin derivatives, videlicet Sulawesins A and Sulawesins B. However, their potentials have not been proven quantitatively yet. Objective: Present study aims to discover a most potent inhibitor of a protein kinase from mentioned propolis by in silico approach which desirably performing minimum side effects. Methods: All data structure of characterized biomarkers used in this study was from Indonesia propolis, original from Sulawesi region which produced by Tetragonula biroi aff. bees. The biomarkers were used as ligands, small molecules that projected as potent inhibitor to bind in the receptor’s active site, while the receptors here were 10 randomly selected group of protein kinases. The analysis study firstly done by evaluating both compounds toward Lipinski’s rule of five to see the potentiality to be an oral drug in further development. The study then continued by performing virtual screening over 10 selected receptors to predict to which receptor best binding conformation formed, using a molecular docking program, namely AutoDock Vina. The program needs the binding parameters, including grid center coordinates and grid size to determine the binding site location and rotational space, hence redocking process was run between the receptor and the native ligand which originally bound to the structure of retrieved receptor from Protein Data Bank. The most likely conformation is determined by the most negative docking score obtained from the simulation and indicated as the most potent inhibitor, while the targeted receptor determined as the most promising target in this study. In order to know the interactions formed between the protein and the ligand, the docking results then visualized in Ligplot+ program for 2-dimensional view of receptor – ligand interactions. Visualization results then compared to the one belongs to the existing anticancer drug to see the similarity. Results: The study revealed that both Sulawesins A and B showed comparable inhibition potential towards Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) with docking score of -8.9 kcal/mol and -8.2 kcal/mol respectively. Conclusion: Based on this study, BTK referred as the most promising target among other protein kinases for the tested ligands used in this study and Sulawesins A concluded as the most potent inhibitor towards it.",
