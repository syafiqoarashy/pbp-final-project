            "speechAbstract": "History of Indonesia's defence industry started from 1958 when the excolonial companies were nationalized and then operated as national companies. In 1980, more focus was given by the formation of Defense and Security Industry Development Team. Military embargo imposed to Indonesia strengthen the program to develop defence industries with the aim to achieve independency. The latest Law No. 16\/2014 is an affirmative policy to side on national defence industry. As implementation of this law, the Ministry of Defence of Republic of Indonesia runs six policy initiatives: (1) Implementation of Local Content and Offset policy in procurement of defence products from overseas, (2) International cooperation, (3) Promotion, (4) Licensing of defence industries and blasting enterprises, (5) Production of First Articles, and (6) Seven National Priority Programs. Currently, the products of Indonesia defence industries have been used by the Indonesia National Armed Forces (TNI), such as: CN-235 MPA aircrafts, NC-212i aircrafts, Super Puma NAS 332 helicopter, NBell 412 helicopter, various types of naval ships, Anoa panser, Komodo tactical vehicles, Harimau medium tank, etc. Aside from that, Indonesia produces various rifles, pistols, ammunition, bombs, and rockets. For defence electronics, various radios, CMS (combat management system), data interlink, etc. Indonesia’s military personnel equipments, such as military uniforms, backpack, boots, parachutes, helmets, have been used in many countries. To keep the industries competitive and able to produce state-ofthe-art products needed by the users, innovation is a must. For this, involvement of universities and research institutes is necessary.",

            "speechAbstract": "A building is an indispensable shelter for humankind since ancient times. It provides places for various productive activities and comfort environment. On the other hand, the building sector is currently one of the main energy consumers in the world. According to IEA Global Status Report 2017, it contributes 30% of the global final energy consumption and 28% of global energy-related CO2 emissions in 2015. Considering the future climate change of both global and urban scale, a suitable built environment which enables to attenuate the risk of health damage from heat-related illness will become more essential especially in equator tropical regions.&nbsp;\\n In principle, human body is kept at a thermally neutral state by evaporation of sweat and the convection heat between the adjacent air and skin surface; however, the efficiency of the latter processes is drastically hindered if the air temperature reaches to the body temperature. As a result, air-conditioning (A\/C) facilities become essential to prevent the heat risk, resulting in the increase of the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, if the current living environment is left unchanged, low-income families without A\/C facilities will directly face the significant risk all through the year in tropical regions. \\n Under these circumstances, the authors have conducted a series of field studies related to building energy use and indoor thermal environment in Malaysia as joint research projects for past years. In the keynote presentation, the authors will introduce three projects, namely, 1) field survey on occupants’ behavior toward A\/C and energy use, 2) experiment of the sleep quality under various cooling strategies, and 3) field measurement in a terrace house to evaluate passive cooling strategies. Based on the findings of these studies, affordable cooling strategies tailored to tropical emerging countries will be discussed. Lastly, a numerical analysis based on a building energy simulation coupled with genetic algorithm optimization will be introduced to discuss about the prospective change of lifestyle related to A\/C use under future scenarios.",

            "speechAbstract": "Owing to the high strength to its weight ratio and excellent corrosion resistance, Ti alloy has become the main candidates for structural and automotive application. Ti-6Al-4V, which is categorized as an α+β Ti alloy, is the most commercially used titanium alloy among the others since it possesses a low material cost while having a synergy in strength and ductility. On the other hand, the use of Ti-6Al-4V alloy is limited because the strength of this alloy is lower compared to the high cost β titanium alloy. Thus, it is not suitable for high-load application. Microstructural design was applied to improve the mechanical property of Ti-6Al-4 alloy by introducing a massive phase transformation. The massive phase (αm) transformation was occurred during the introduction of high cooling rates to avoid α diffusion formation and should form before the alloy reaches the martensite start temperature, during the cooling from the β phase region. Thus, the αm have a morphology characteristic between lamellar and martensite. The αm morphology was reported to be consisted of α sub-lamellar with the width of α is approximately 1 μm. The fine width of α and the occurrence of high dislocation in the αm combined resulting in the increment of mechanical property while still maintaining the ductility of Ti-6Al-4V alloy.&nbsp;",

They are being used in in-vitro diagnostic (IVD), energy harvesting, automotive and navigation, telecommunication and drug screening devices to cite a few. Microsystem, typically made up of components below 1 millimetre in size, exploit microscale phenomena to develop innovative miniature devices including sensors and actuators. Due to their size, they can be manufactured at low-unit cost through mass-production. Yet, the development (and teaching) of microsystems has typically been limited to upper income countries due to the initial investment costs associated with the microfabrication equipment and processes. However, recent technological advances have enabled the development of low-cost microfabrication tools. In this paper, we review a range of low-cost microfabrication approaches and equipment, developed and implemented in our laboratories. We describe processes used for the microfabrication of structural and functional materials. Our paper covers conventional microfabrication processes such as photolithography and lift-off, but we also describe micro-milling and 3D printing, and a range of less conventional processes that can be used to shape a range of materials with sub-millimetre feature sizes. Finally, we show how selected techniques are combined to develop an integrated, microfluidics-based, biosensing platform. We anticipate that this paper, which will enable researchers to build a low-cost microfabrication toolbox, will spark a new interest in countries that have been excluded to-date, from the microsystems revolution due to high investment costs.",

These figures indicate a dire need to provide more opportunities for children to be physically active daily through active school travel (walking, cycling), free play and peer-play so that they are able to develop better all-round fitness, a wider range of social skills, and greater mental resilience. Schools and communities have attempted to design programs to encourage healthy lifestyles through walking and cycling to school. Although child health statistics have plateaued and they suggest that a new approach is needed. Some of the major barriers include real and perceived issues of road safety and hazards lack of meaningful community engagement buy-in to walk and cycle to school programs. For example, research undertaken in the ACT from 2016-2018 show that engaging children in the process of designing new solutions for their health and wellbeing can be a way forward in establishing healthy habits and social norms around walking and cycling to school.

            "speechAbstract": "Utility infrastructure assets in the United States continue to grow as millions of utility features were installed within the properties of state and local agencies. With this growth, the management of the utility data records is becoming a complex problem in terms of large amounts of data. On one hand, management of data for utility infrastructures is extremely valuable to state and local agencies because the timely access to utility-related information is a significant requirement for the delivery of construction and renovation projects on time and within budget. On the other hand, many challenges arise, such as difficulties in effective data storage of complex and messy datasets, data analysis, and data visualization. Utility owners face challenges in collecting utility data in standardized formats, data storage, and providing easy access to all stakeholders. Using a case study in Nevada, this paper demonstrates how tools and a strategic workflow process can be harnessed to develop an end-to-end management solution for large and complex data of a utility infrastructure. This end-to-end utility data management solution builds upon existing systems which are not adequate for large utility data management because they are non-scalable, do not allow for access by multiple users, involve manual data uploads, do not control consistency of data attributes, and lack visualization tools for non-GIS experts. In addition, they do not provide an end-to-end data management pipeline from data acquisition, through data integration, quality control, storage and finally to data access. The developed system in this case study was used for an end-to-end management test of large data during the testing phase and proved to perform seamlessly. Our approach could be adopted by other utility jurisdictions to manage their utility data. Such a data management system allows for automated and proper management of utility data thereby helping state and local agencies reduce utility conflicts and offset construction costs due to utility damages. This data could be combined with other rich data sources, such as financial data, and mined for valuable, hidden insights.",

            "speechAbstract": "Among the states of the United States, the State of Florida is at the most significant risk associated with the impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise and increasing storm surge, increased hurricane intensity, and temperature increases.&nbsp; This presentation will present ongoing work for the Florida Department of Transportation on the long-term risks associated with developing a statewide transportation plan.&nbsp; In addition to the impacts of climate changes, the state of Florida faces other risks associated with five broad categories of risk - population, demographics and migration; economics and revenue; technology; global issues including security; and environmental. In this presentation, we will first define risk, then discuss the changes that are happening in each of these five areas of risk. We will then use the risks associated with climate change and its associated impacts to understand how the risks can be magnified by the interaction of separate categories of risk. Finally, we identify the challenges to developing long-range plans, including transportation plans in the face of great uncertainty.",

OCT is a new technology that provides an atraumatic \"optical biopsy\" providing both anatomical and possible histopathologic results. Although the first generation of OCT systems were in the non-invasive diagnostic for ophthalmology, its development spreads to other medical applications. New applications are emerging in various medical fields, e.g. early-stage cancer detection, surgical guidance, and early diagnosis of diseases. OCT has also proven its value as a tool for developmental biology. The presentation will review the principle of OCT and highlight recent advances and future developments of OCT technology.",

            "speechAbstract": "Among many alloys used in medical applications, NiTi shape memory alloys are widely used either for the production of medical devices or implants. Besides exhibiting unique properties of shape memory effect (SME) and pseudo-elasticity (PE), the alloy also excellent in corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. Among the metal processing routes, Powder Metallurgy (PM) has been found as the most promising method, particularly for small, intricate and complex geometries of biomedical implants. The implants can be in two different structures; dense and porous which apply for different applications. This paper highlights some of the important aspects in manufacturing of NiTi alloys by PM routes, covering from conventional compaction, metal injection moulding (MIM) and additive manufacturing (AM). Some significant aspects from metallurgical and biocompatibility points of view are also presented.",
